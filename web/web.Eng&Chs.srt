and compress them into a single calendar year,
都给它压缩到365天的日历中

回到大爆炸发生的1月1日夜里

The universe starts January 1st,

每一分钟代表着3万年

264

晚上11:46 距离午夜14分钟 人类才学会用火

265

I wanted to go skating.
溜旱冰

541

I used to love skating.

542

Then you should go skating.

Maybe I should.

546
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,060

I like Oreos better, but...
我其实更喜欢奥利奥 不过...

551
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,070
That's just the way the cookie crumbles, right?
就像是盒巧克力 不能每颗都合心意 对吧？

552
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,640
Gingersnaps don't crumble.
姜饼干里没巧克力

553

At least not until you crunch them...

554
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,540
You better go home, I guess.

It's too dark for skating without streetlights.

599
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,060

600
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,540
-All good. Taylor? -Yeah, thanks.
-泰勒 都差不多了吧？ -嗯 谢了

泰勒和麦克都在城堡街的心疗唱片店打零工

在茱莉亚他们教你多动脑子

在泰勒眼里 跟着鼓点走就对了 多想一下灵感就跑了

不在乎魔术帽空着 里面只有她自己放的钱

还有个滑板小子随随便便丢进去的硬币

Motherfucker!
王八蛋！

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,030
It was totally unexpected, like having a door slammed in your face just as you were getting ready to walk through it.
这突如其来 犹如当头一棒把门关在脸上

她打算回家后喝点酒 顺便哭一场

629
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,090
Maybe queue up one of her big band playlists and dance drunk around the room.
说不定还会播个爵士乐 在屋里醉舞一番

She loved to dance in high school.

可他却停下脚步

671
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,100
Come on.
赏个脸

672
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,020
Come on, little sister.

{\an8}魔术帽

Do you need a-any help at all or...

Here, can you, uh, take this?

-Sure. -Just, just spin the thingy here.
-好 -拧这里

690
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,500
-Yeah, yeah. -To doing something else.

That was incredible.
跳的太神了

693

You dance for a living?
你们是舞蹈演员吗？

694
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,870
No. Oh, no. I...
哦 不 不

695
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,870
-No, I do not, sir. -What do you do for a living?
-不 不是的 -你做什么的？

696
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,850
Oh, no, I think I... Did I... I didn't break it, did I?

I think he broke it.
这个好像坏了

698
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,840
Let's hit the pond.
去喷泉吧

699
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,170
We'll never find parking by the Common.
那儿没停车位

700
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,570
We will today.

Today...is magic.

Where did you learn to dance like that?

703
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,400
Oh, no, no, no, that's yours.
别 别 别 那是你赚的

704
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,010
Nope, we split it even.
不 有福同享

705
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,470
By myself, I wouldn't have made half as much if I drummed till midnight.
要我自己敲 一天也赚不了这么多

706
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,610
You okay?
你没事吧？

707
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,340
Yeah.
还好

708
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,690
Yeah. Just one of my headaches.
就是有点头疼

709
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,820
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. I don't need it. You keep it.

Come on, man, you earned it.
来吧 老兄 你应得的

拿去吃顿饭 转手送人也行 但这钱我偏要交给你

712
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,400
You could do this for a living, you know?
你们干这行都能当职业了

713
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,360
I don't know about that.
我可不敢这么说

714
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,300
I really think we could busk our way to fame and fortune.
我真觉得靠街头表演 我们能红 能赚大钱

715
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,830
What made you stop in front of me?
你怎么会停在我面前？

716
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,620
Why did you start moving?
又为什么突然跳起舞？

717
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,470
He could say it was because he was thinking about his old half-assed band, The Retros,
他本可说鼓点让他想起他那不成气候的追旧青年乐队

718
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:29,370
and how he liked to dance across the stage during instrumental breaks.
他还喜欢跟着节奏跳舞

719
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,160
But that's not it.
但他没这么说

720
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,760
I don't know.
我也说不清

721
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,960
Taylor, we gotta roll,
泰勒 该走了

722
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,450
or you're gonna end up spending your take on my parking ticket.
不然你赚的钱都得交罚单了

723
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,060
So, you guys don't want a career change?
你们不考虑转行跳舞吗？

724
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,970
Career change? How... I mean...

We'll make a name for ourselves.

726
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,980
You got to get in here before you go.

Buskers forever.

732
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,430
Yeah. Buskers forever.
好了 好了

733
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,690
We gotta roll before the meter maid shows up.
得赶在贴罚单前抓紧走

734
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,610
I'm so sorry.
真替你难过

735
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,310
That sucks.

736
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,290
It does suck.
这确实倒霉

737
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,880
I thought he was a nice guy.
我真觉得他人还不错

738
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,420
He was a pretty good lover, and we had fun and all that.
床上功夫也到位 我们在一起挺开心的

739
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,370
If I can find a video of us dancing, which I'm gonna look because I bet we go viral,
我回去得找下我们跳舞的视频 估计会上热搜

740
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:44,940
I'm gonna send it to him with a text, a text that says, "This is what you're missing."
然后转发给他 再附句“这就是你错过的缘分”

741
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,680
You're gonna be fine.
你会没事的

742
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,710
I don't know a lot, but I know that much.
我不是全都懂 可这件事我很清楚

743
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:07,640
You got a bright sunbeam in front of you, and you're gonna step right into it, I can tell.
光辉就在你前面 往前迈一步乌云就消散

744
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,240
But yeah.
但现在

745
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,350
It sucks. Not much else to say.
真倒霉 没啥好说的

746
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,020
Everything goes down the drain, and all we can say is, "That sucks."
一切都完了 我们也只剩下句真倒霉

747
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,220
Yeah.
对

748
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,940
Maybe we're going down the drain too.
说不定谁都躲不掉这劫

749
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,640
Maybe.
说不定

750
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,420
I'm this way.
我走这条路

751
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,390
Uh, I'm that way.
我往那边走

752
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,620
Thank you for the dance.
多谢你陪我跳舞

753
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,360
As he passes the place where Taylor set up her drums,
当他走过泰勒摆鼓的地方

754
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,430
those two questions recur.
那两个问题又冒了出来

755
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,280
Why did he stop to listen?
为什么要停下脚步听？

756
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,270
And why did he start to dance?
又为什么要跳起舞？

757
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,130
He doesn't know.
他自己也想不通

758
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:06,210
And would answers make a good thing better?
有答案能让这回忆更动人吗？

759
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,910
Later, he'll lose the ability to walk,
后来 他走路都成问题

760
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,740
never mind dancing with little sister on the promenade.
和那个小老妹跳舞成了个传说

761
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,140
Later, he'll lose the ability to chew food.
再后来 他咀嚼都成了难题

762
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,190
Later, he'll forget his wife's name.
再后来 他记不住妻子的名字

763
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:29,150
Later, he'll lose his grip on the difference between waking and sleeping
到最后 他分不清白日黑夜

764
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:38,160
and enter a land of pain so great he will wonder why God made the world.
陷入一种让人质疑生命意义的巨大痛苦中

765
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:45,080
What he will remember, occasionally, is how he stopped and dropped his briefcase
但有时 他还会记得当初把公文包一丢

766
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,690
and began to move his hips to the beat of the drums.
跟着鼓点起舞的感觉

767
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,830
And he will think that is why God made the world.
他会觉得 这就是上帝让世界存在的意义

768
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,930
Just that.
仅此而已

769
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,390
{\an8}第一幕

770
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,160
{\an8}第一幕
我包罗万象

771
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,940
Chuck was looking forward to having a baby sister.
查克一直盼着能有个小妹妹

772
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,950
Of course, he was also looking forward to having parents,
更盼着父母能赶紧回来

773
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:37,070
but none of that worked out thanks to a patch 95 of well-hidden ice on an I-95 overpass.
谁料95号高架上结的冰让一切化为泡影

774
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,130
Chuck wasn't in the car when it happened
事发时查克没在车上

775
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,920
because his parents were having a dinner date
他父母去享受二人世界

776
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,360
and he was being babysat by his grandparents,
那天晚上他爷爷奶奶带他

777
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,270
who, at the time, he was still calling Zaydee and Bubbie.
他那会儿还叫他们阿爷阿奶

778
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,860
{\an9}Zaydee和Bubbie是东欧犹太移民常用的祖父母称呼

779
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,840
He was seven years old.
他那时七岁了

780
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,920
Excellent job.
真赞喔

781
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:01,070
For a year and a half, it was a house of unadulterated sadness.
一年半载 屋子里全是悲伤

782
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:05,990
Albie and Sarah Krantz had not only lost their son and daughter-in-law...
对阿尔比和莎拉·克兰兹来说 不只是儿子和儿媳没了

783
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,470
Why're you not eating?
咋不吃饭了？

784
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,070
...they had lost the granddaughter who would've been born just three months later.
那本该三个月后出生的孙女也没了

What's going on?
咋回事儿？

786
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,080
The name had already been picked out...
名字都选好了...

787
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,520
-Her name is Alyssa. -...Alyssa.
-她叫艾雨莎 -艾雨莎

788
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,060
When Chuck said that sounded to him like rain,
查克说那名字听着像下雨时

789
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,130
his mother had laughed and cried at the same time.
他妈哭笑不得

790
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,430
He never forgot that.
他永远忘不了那表情

791
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:34,800
Albie processed his grief by turning to his two absolutes,

792
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,190
numbers and alcohol.

793
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,110

但对莎拉来说 一切却都失去了滋味

794
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:47,980
She loved the flavors of life, music, art, and food,
曾让她陶醉的音乐 艺术和美食

795
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,500
but now, found the world quiet and gray and flavorless.
如今都索然无味

796
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,860
Some of the good feelings came back into the house with time.
随着时间流逝 家里又慢慢有了些温暖

797
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,480
There were a lot of takeout meals after the accident,
事故后全靠外卖度日

798
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,740

但查克快十岁那年 他奶奶又重新下厨

799
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,590
She liked rock-and-roll while she was cooking.
她做饭时爱放摇滚乐

800
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:20,600
Music Chuck would've thought much too young for her, but which she clearly enjoyed.
查克肯定觉得太潮了 可她显然乐在其中

801
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:42,440
Come on, little brother, let's dance.

我打赌 从阁楼往外看 能看到西福商场

整座小镇肯定也能看得一清二楚

要真上去了 你看见的可不只是风景

told him to be quiet. Be quiet and wait.
告诉他别吭声 安静地等着

So, Miss Rohrbacher mostly put him with the girls who were clumsy.
老师常让他和不会跳的女生搭档

1069
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:30,180
He understood she did it to make them better, and he was a good sport about it.
他明白老师的用意 也乐意帮忙

1070
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,750
Near the end of their two hours, however,
快下课前

1071
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:38,100
The Dance Monster would show mercy and pair him with Cat McCoy,
舞林怪才才心软 让他和凯特·麦考伊搭档

1072
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:43,890
who was an eighth grader and the best dancer of the girls.
她八年级 也是所有女生里跳得最溜的

1073
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,630
Chuck didn't expect romance.
查克可没动她的心思

1074
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:51,640
Cat was not only gorgeous, she was a full foot taller than he was.
卡特确实漂亮 不过也比他高一头

1075
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:56,770
But he loved to dance with her, and the feeling was mutual.
但他很喜欢和她一起跳 她也有同感

1076
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,430
...three. Out, two, three. Switch.
...外 二 三 转

1077
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,250
And stop.
好 停

1078
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:03,870
In, two, three. Out, two, three.
内 二 三 外 二 三

1079
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,600
Turn. Now box.
转 换箱步

1080
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:11,920
One, two, three. One, two, three.
一 二 三 一 二 三

1081
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,270
I don't know what that is.
看 你 们 跳 的 啥

1082
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:15,880
Oh, my God.
老 天 呐

1083
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:20,610
Okay, 10 minutes freestyle.
算了 自由练十分钟

1084
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,780
Hey. Watch this.
嘿 瞧好

1085
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,080
Show me how you did that.
快教我

1086
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,560
Ready?
看好

1087
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,520
Slide, slide, slide.
滑 滑 滑

1088
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,650
Here, ready?
来试试

1089
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,130
Try it with me.
来跟我学

1090
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,960
Uh, kick off your shoes and do it in your socks.
不行 把鞋脱了 穿袜子滑

1091
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,640
Aye-aye.
遵命

1092
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,280
Now, slide.
滑右脚

1093
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,270
Slide.
滑左脚

1094
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,620
Yeah. There you go.
看 你学会了

1095
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:14,670
Hey! Show me.
来 让我看看

1096
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,160
Pop. Slide. Pop. Slide. Slide. Slide.

1097
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,550
Yeah, again.
再来次

1098
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,890
Pop. Slide. Pop.
停 滑 停

1099
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,130
Twirlers and Spinners let out half an hour late that day.
那天下课晚了半小时

1100
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,260
That's so rad. You figured that out by yourself?
刚太酷了 你自己琢磨出来的吗？

1101
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:41,970
Well, I just kept rewinding and rewinding 'til I figured it out.
我就不断回放 反复看 最终学会的

1102
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,940
We should do that at the Fling.
在舞会那天我们一起跳这个吧

1103
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:50,230
Uh, not as a date or anything.
呃 别误会 才不是要跟你谈恋爱

1104
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,890
I'm going out with Dougie Wentworth.
我跟道奇·温特沃斯在一起

1105
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,480
You know that, right?
你知道吧？

1106
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,360
Yeah.
知道

1107
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:02,380
But that doesn't mean we couldn't show them some cool moves.
可这不妨碍我们露露绝活

1108
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,350
I really want to. Do you?
我超想跳 你呢？

1109
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,990
I-I don't know.
我 我不确定

1110
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,840
I'm a lot shorter.
我太矮了

1111
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,540
I think people will laugh.
人们会笑话我的

1112
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,600
-That totally works. -It totally does.
-这管用 -确实管用

1113
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,850
-Are you sure? -Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
-确定吗？ -当然确定

1114
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,890
Well, they feel great!
感觉很好

1115
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,810
Uh, just a little big.
就是码有点大

1116
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,240
That should be enough.
差不多了

1117
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,050
-Little more. -Maybe one more.
-再塞点 -再塞点

1118
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,790
How's that?
怎么样？

1119
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:49,430
Floor feels like ice.
就像溜冰一样

1120
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:52,840
You put scratches on that floor, the janitor is gonna beat y...
要是把地板刮花 可要被揍

1121
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:58,040
Timmy. There won't be no scratches. He's too light on his feet to leave any.
蒂米 不会刮花的 他很轻的

1122
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:01,920
Almost perfect.
几乎都对了

1123
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:08,510
Take another run at these two.
这两题再算一遍

1124
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,230
You don't need to sigh. You're good at this, you know?
别叹气 你有这方面天赋 知道吗？

1125
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,880
You're really good at it.
你真的很出色

1126
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,450
Yeah, but it's boring.
好吧 可这也太枯燥了

1127
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:19,230
Boring? What, you mean math?
枯燥？是说数学吗？

1128
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,410
Yeah.
嗯

1129
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:25,100
I wonder if maybe next semester you might want to try Math League after school.
我觉得你下学期课后应该报个数学竞赛社

1130
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:29,040
I did it all high school, in fact, and it was so great.
我整个高中都在参加 特有趣

1131
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:32,070
I'm doing Twirlers and Spinners.
我现在报的是舞蹈社团

1132
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,820
Yeah.
对

1133
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:38,630
Hey, hey, put that down for a second, will you?
嘿 先放下笔 先听我说说

1134
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,090
Just a little about math.
说点数学的事

1135
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,390
Because people start out thinking it might be boring,
人们最初都以为它很枯燥

1136
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,960
and that's their first mistake.
这就是错在起点

1137
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,410
It's used in every career, in every job,
无论干什么职业 做哪份工作

1138
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,480
in every facet of life on this planet.
地球上生活的方方面面都离不开它

1139
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,700
That's a fact. Hell, the planet.
毋庸置疑 就连地球自己也离不开它

1140
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,800
How do you think we figure out how long a day is?
一天到底有多长？

1141
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,340
Everybody knows how long a day is.
谁都知道一天有多长

1142
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,930
-How long? -Twenty-four hours.
-多长？ -24小时

1143
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:08,410
People say it's 24 hours, but they're wrong.
大家都说一天有24小时 但这是错的

1144
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:13,900
There are 23 hours and 56 minutes in a stellar day.
在恒星日中一天有23小时零56分钟

1145
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,510
Plus a few odd seconds. Math proves it.
还零几秒钟 数学可以证明

1146
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,950
How do we know how old the Earth is?
怎么知道地球存在多久？

1147
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:23,250
How old the universe is, how long people have been here?
宇宙存在多久？人类又存在多久？

1148
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:28,000
Or how to build a bridge or a skyscraper or how far apart the stars are?
又怎么建桥 盖楼 测星距

1149
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,830
How did we land on the moon?
怎么登月的？

1150
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,680
The stars themselves. Why they burn, why atoms split and fuse,
星星是怎么燃烧的？原子怎么聚变裂变的？

1151
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,840
and all the rest is just math.
这些都离不开数学

1152
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,580
Hey, stars are just math.
星星本身就是数学产物

1153
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,540
When you look at the night sky,
当你仰望夜空时

1154
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,630
you're seeing the greatest equation in the universe.
看到的是宇宙最壮丽的方程式

1155
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,460
Heck, your dancing, that's math too.
更别说你的舞蹈 那也是数学

1156
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,460
I mean, what's the language of dance?
舞蹈的语言到底是什么？

1157
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,450
How do you learn your steps?
你怎么学舞步的？

1158
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,040
 It's even in the name. I mean, they call it "the count."
名字就在那里 叫数拍

1159
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:59,680
One and two and three and four.
一 二 三 四

1160
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,510
What's a waltz? One, two, three, one, two, three.
华尔兹呢？一 二 三 一 二 三

1161
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,690
Just numbers, just math.
全是数字 都是数学

1162
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,800
And more than that,
不仅如此

1163
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:10,610
there's an art to it.
数学可以是门艺术

1164
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:15,570
What I do, all these files here, all these folders,
我干的活儿 你看这堆文件 这些档案

1165
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:18,320
these are all people's lives.
记录的都是人们的生活

1166
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:20,970
Every choice they made.
他们每个选择

1167
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,390
Last year, last 10 years.
去年 过去十年

1168
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,540
Everything that's important to them.
他们在意的一切

1169
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,710
Every weakness they have, every vice, every dream,
所有缺点 嗜好和梦想

1170
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:32,670
it's all here in numbers.
全都体现在数字里

1171
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:35,150
Some schmuck comes in, takes those numbers,
要是哪个外行进来 生搬硬算

1172
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:39,160
does the math without artistry, someone loses their house.
缺了艺术感 就能害人丢了房子

1173
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:43,160
I take those numbers, do a little art,
而我注入一丝艺术匠心

1174
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,600
I save someone's life.
便能救人于难

1175
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,250
That's what I do.
这就是会计的魅力

1176
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:51,050
That's what accounting is.
这就是会计的意义

1177
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,110
Well, maybe they should teach that, the cool stuff,
也许他们该教这些有趣的

1178
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,300
and not just all the boring stuff.
别教枯燥的

1179
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,460
Hmm.
嗯

1180
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,710
Math is something else too.
数学可不止这些

1181
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:14,540
Some math, math that's called statistics or probability,
像统计学 概率学

1182
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,030
it can tell you stuff about your future.
可以未卜先知

1183
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:21,560
It could tell you, for example,
比方说

1184
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:25,630
you're more likely to be drafted by a major league sports team
你进职业球队的几率

1185
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:29,610
than to make a real living as a dancer.
大过靠跳舞谋生

1186
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,780
The world loves dancers, it truly does.
大家都爱看跳舞 没错

1187
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,700
But it needs accountants,
可社会更需要会计师

1188
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,840
so there's much more demand, so there's much more opportunity.
需求大所以机会也多

1189
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:48,050
I know that might hurt, but it's the truth.
我知道这话扎心 但这就是事实

1190
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:53,060
Math is truth. It won't lie to you.
数学只讲事实 它不会撒谎

1191
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,810
It doesn't factor in your preferences. It's pure that way.
数学不掺感情 它就是这么纯粹

1192
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,560
Math can do a lot of things.
数学能做很多事

1193
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,380
Math can be art.
数学可以是门艺术

1194
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,860
But it can't lie.
但数学可不会撒谎

1195
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,880
So...
所以...

1196
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:15,560
take another run at those two because, Chucko,
再把那两题重算一遍吧

1197
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,520
you are good.
小查 你很出色

1198
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,990
You... have art in you.
你有 艺术细胞

1199
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,170
Hey! You look great!

1200
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:09,260
Thanks. Uh, you too.
谢谢 你也是

1201
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:12,310
Wanna show 'em how it's done?
想不想给他们露两手？

1202
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:19,020
Uh, I don't know. I kinda, um...I kinda hurt my leg.
这个 我不 我 我可能扭到脚了

1203
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,090
You hurt your leg?
真的假的？

1204
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:24,660
Maybe, maybe let's, let's wait for a better song.
要不 要不 等首更好的歌吧？

1205
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,780
Hey, kiddo.
嘿 小子

1206
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,850
Hey.
嘿

1207
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:55,180
Thought you were gonna tear it up tonight.
我以为你今晚要大放异彩呢

1208
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,360
I don't, I don't know.
我 我也不知道

1209
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,520
My shoes feel all funny,
鞋子怪怪的

1210
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:03,470
and... I hurt my leg.
我 我脚扭了

1211
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,670
Oh, you hurt your leg?
哦 你脚扭了？

1212
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,020
Yeah.
嗯

1213
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:11,230
I'm sorry to hear that.
真替你可惜

1214
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,980
So, you came stag, huh?
你一个人来的？

1215
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,570
-Hmm? -No date.
-啥？-没带约会对象？

1216
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,290
Nah, I...
没 我

1217
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:22,950
That'll change. Believe me, it'll change. Just give it some time.
情况会变的 相信我 迟早会变 再等等

1218
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,770
None of this, none of...
舞池里这些...

1219
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,650
None of that out there really means anything.
舞池里这些都不重要

1220
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:33,440
It's all just, just a scrimmage. Just a practice.
跳得怎样 都只是热身和演习 别把它当真

1221
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,830
Hey, this is perfect. Come on.
嘿 这首正好 来跳吧

1222
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,180
Nah, I'm still, uh...
不行 我...

1223
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,750
My leg's still wonky.
我脚还怪怪的

1224
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:43,660
Chuck, come on. We're gonna blow the roof off.
查克 得了吧 让我们炸翻全场

1225
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,370
I'm sorry.
对不起

1226
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,270
It really hurts.
真的很痛

1227
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:07,690
You know, I've been dancing since I was eight, and I teach PE,
我从八岁就开始跳舞 又教体育

1228
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,120
and I've seen when my kids get hurt.
看过不少孩子受伤后的样子

1229
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,630
I see how their walk changes.
他们走路都不一样了

1230
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,570
I see how their posture changes.
站姿也怪

1231
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,720
And don't mind me saying, but you look...
说句实话 在我看来

1232
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,400
Well, you look fine to me, Chuck.
查克 你看上去好好的

1233
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,060
I'm not saying that you have to dance with the girl. It's up to you.
我没逼你非得跟她跳 决定权在你

1234
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:31,200
 I'm just saying dance or no dance, you don't have to lie.
我只想说 不管跳不跳 别说谎

1235
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,650
Tell her the truth.
跟她实话实说

1236
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:38,700
She can take it.
她会理解的

1237
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:54,720
-You ready? -Yeah. Let's do it.

1238
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:20,520
One more time! One more time!
再跳一遍！再跳一遍！

1239
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:28,420
They may have been young, but they were smart enough to know when to quit.
他们年纪虽小 却足够聪明知道何时收场

1240
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:35,390
Thank you, guys.
谢谢大家

1241
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:40,700
Six months before he died of a brain tumor at the unfair age of 39,
在他39岁因脑瘤早逝前六个月

1242
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,440
and while his mind was still working, mostly,
趁头脑还算清楚

1243
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:50,750
Chuck told his wife the truth about the scar on the back of his hand.
他跟妻子珍妮坦白了手背上疤的来历

1244
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:52,620
When they'd first started dating,
最开始交往时

1245
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,250
he told her he'd gotten it from a boy named Doug Wentworth,
他说这疤是那晚舞会后

1246
01:34:56,270 --> 01:35:01,150
who was pissed about him dancing with his girlfriend at a middle school formal
舞伴凯特的男友温特沃斯因为吃醋

1247
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:04,530
and pushed him into a chain link fence outside the gym.
把他推到围栏上铁丝划的

1248
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,710
I lied about that, though.
这疤我没说真话

1249
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:14,680
Oh, my. A man of secrets, even still.
哇 你还是这么神秘

1250
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,870
What happened, love?
亲爱的 怎么弄的？

1251
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:20,560
When our fabulous dance was over, I...
那晚舞跳完

1252
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,740
I was sweaty and I was so hot.
我全身又汗又热

1253
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,920
I-I felt like my cheeks were gonna catch fire.
脸都热得通红

1254
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,190
You were great.
跳的太好了

1255
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,870
-Thank you. -What a star.
-谢谢 -真是个大明星啊

1256
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,490
All I wanted in that moment was just darkness,
我那时只想逃离灯光

1257
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:39,950
cool air, and to be by myself.
吹吹凉风 一个人呆会儿

1258
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,720
There were millions of stars that night.
那晚天空繁星闪烁

1259
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,590
Millions of them.
千万星辰

1260
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:50,330
And millions more behind them.
千层万叠

1261
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:55,290
And sure, m-may... Yeah, maybe they were just math.
也许 嗯 它们只是天文数字

1262
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,920
But they also danced.
却好像在翩翩起舞

1263
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,380
I know 'cause I saw one of them.
我知道 因为那一瞬我看见了

1264
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,520
And I remember thinking, the universe is large
我那时想 宇宙边疆无限

1265
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,060
and, and it contains multitudes,
宇宙包罗万象

1266
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:13,460
but it-it also contains me.
也包含了我

1267
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:19,670
And in this moment...I am wonderful.
而在那一刻 我真觉得自己很精彩

1268
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:22,920
And I have a right to be wonderful.
我理应拥有这份精彩

1269
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,870
Oh!
啊

1270
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,160
Why lie about that, silly?
干嘛为这事撒谎 小傻瓜

1271
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:35,070
You're a strange wonder, my dear.
你真是个奇妙的存在 亲爱的

1272
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:41,990
He doesn't offer more because the scar was important for another reason.
他没再多说 因为那道疤另有深意

1273
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:45,170
It was part of a story he couldn't tell,
是他讲不完的故事的一环

1274
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:50,180
even though there was now an apartment building on the site of the Victorian house
其中有他长大的那幢维多利亚老宅

1275
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,740
where he had done most of his growing up.
尽管早拆了盖楼了

1276
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,960
The haunted Victorian house.
那幢闹鬼的维多利亚老宅

1277
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,860
No reason.
不知道

1278
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:03,100
Funny thinking, I guess.
就是心血来潮吧

1279
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,630
The scar meant more, so he had made it more.
这疤意义非凡 他也尽力讲得加料

1280
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:12,070
He just couldn't make it as much more as it really was.
可讲得总没有它真正的意义深

1281
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:14,290
That made little sense.
讲得还有点糊涂

1282
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:18,690
But as the glioblastoma continued its blitzkrieg,
但随着脑癌细胞的疯狂进攻

1283
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:24,910
it was the best his disintegrating mind could manage.
他那快散架的大脑最多也只能讲到这样

1284
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:58,640
Chuck's grandpa, his Zaydee,
查克的爷爷 他的阿爷

1285
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:04,470
died of a heart attack five years after the Fall Fling dance.
在那场秋季舞会五年后 因心脏病发作去世

1286
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:06,920
Chuck was a junior in high school
事发时查克读高二

1287
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:08,730
singing in a band and
是乐队主唱

1288
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,980
dancing like Jagger during the instrumental breaks.
正在台上像摇滚巨星一样跳得带劲儿

1289
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,220
He made all the arrangements himself.
他自己都安排妥当了

1290
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,120
Came in a few weeks ago
几周前

1291
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:20,730
just to make sure everything was to the letter,
还特地来馆里再确认一遍

1292
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:23,010
which I thought was strange.
我还纳闷呢

1293
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,390
Not many people bother to do that.
很少有人这么上心

1294
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:30,010
Most people, they come here once to set it all up.
大多数人只来一趟定好流程

1295
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,410
They aren't anxious to come back again.
办好手续就不再来了

1296
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:40,070
Next time I see 'em, they're in their Sunday best, if you get me.
再见到那人 都是穿着体面衣服躺那儿 懂吧

1297
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:44,180
He was a great man and a good friend.
他人特好 也是我多年的好友

1298
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,750
He's been doing our books for 23 years
他为我们做账整整二十三年了

1299
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:53,040
and saved our skin more than once when the tax man was coming.
账做得稳 多次税务检查都帮我们顺利过关

1300
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:56,340
So, do I owe you any money?
要现在给你结账吗？

1301
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,940
Not a penny.
一分都不用

1302
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:03,700
He took care of that too. Settled his tab that same visit.
他那次来就把钱全给结清了

1303
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,500
You know...
听我说

1304
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,050
the strangest thing.
最离奇的是

1305
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,400
And this will sound strange, so bear with me.
这事儿很怪 可别觉得我扯

1306
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:13,050
See,
说来话长

1307
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:18,110
I, uh, dreamed of being a television weatherman in my salad days
年轻时我曾想当电视上天气预报员

1308
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:20,850
with maybe one of the networks.
也许能成全国台的

1309
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,980
Wasn't in the cards for me.
最终没成

1310
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:28,120
But I did spend a summer at WKNB.
倒是去地方台待过一个夏天

1311
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,950
Well, there was a guy at KNB who they said
在那儿 有个同事号称能

1312
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:38,930
could feel a storm coming two solid weeks away without the radar.
不用雷达就能提前两周感知风暴

1313
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,690
Had a sixth sense.
有第六感

1314
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,040
Damnedest thing I ever saw.
简直了

1315
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,350
Uh, used to make this face,
他会露出一种神情

1316
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:48,830
this face when people talked about their travel plans,
当别人说要出远门

1317
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,920
if he knew something they didn't.
然后他洞察出什么后

1318
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:55,930
Not... not a smile, per se. No joy in it.
那神情不笑不乐

1319
01:39:55,950 --> 01:40:00,370
Just a... knowing.
就一脸 我全知道的样子

1320
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:03,310
"Weatherman Stare," I called it.
我管那叫 预报员天眼

1321
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:06,010
And I didn't have it, not me.
我可没那本事

1322
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,890
So, I'm here, not there.
所以我在这行 而不是那行

1323
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:16,600
Your granddad had that same face when he was in here.
你爷爷来时也带着同样的神情

1324
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:20,730
Like... he knew it was gonna rain.
像是 他早料到要下雨

1325
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,480
And I was just a guy selling him an umbrella.
而我只是个卖他伞的人

1326
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,770
Weatherman Stare.
那就是预报员天眼

1327
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,370
I'm sure of it.
我敢打包票

1328
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:33,110
The strangest thing.
太离谱了

1329
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,450
Albie left him everything.
爷爷阿尔比把一切家当都留给了他

1330
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:40,090
More than enough to pay for his college education.
这足够支付他的大学学费

1331
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:43,450
And later on, the sale of the Victorian
再后来 他把那幢维多利亚老宅卖了

1332
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,430
paid for the house he and Ginny moved into
用这笔钱买了

1333
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:50,460
after their honeymoon in the Catskills.
和他妻子珍妮度蜜月后住的新家

-Look, I love you guys... -He said.
-听着 我真的很爱你们... -他这样说

...but this is where I grew up and want to stay till college.
...但我在这里长大的 也想在这待到上大学

I'm 17. I'm not a baby.
我都17了 不是小孩子了

1338
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:09,650
So, they, both long retired, came to him and stayed in the Victorian

说实话 查克并不怎么想他们

1345

他跟他阿爷一样 最讨厌瞎折腾 也受不了人多

1346
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,470
A day before they were scheduled to arrive,

Chuck finally opened the envelope

that had been sitting on the table in the front hall.

里面装着阿尔比·克兰兹的个人物品

1352

And likely, Chuck supposed,

perhaps the night Chuck had stolen his keys,

Albie had even seen himself crumpled to the floor,

01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:28,770
still clutching his upper arm.

"It's the waiting," he'd said.

"That's the hard part."

Now Chuck's own waiting would begin.

There was a final bip from the unseen monitor

and then that was gone too.

1367

He was just gone.
