{\an8}课后兴趣班纳新
游泳社团 舞蹈社团 数学竞赛社

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,780
...这非混沌 也非死亡
"It is not chaos or death.

7
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,650
是形象 契合 蓝图
"It is form and union and plan.

8
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,550
是永恒的生命
"It is eternal life.

9
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,460
是幸福
"It is happiness.

10
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:27,060
{\an9}诗为美国诗人沃尔特·惠特曼《草叶集·自我之歌》

11
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,750
过去与现在都已凋零
"The past and present wilt.

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,660
我充盈它们 又将它们掏空
"I have filled them, emptied them,

13
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,530
然后继续去充盈未来的下一折页
"and proceed to fill my next fold of the future.

14
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,750
云端的倾听者啊！有何秘密要向我倾诉？
"Listener up there! What have you to confide to me?

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,670
当我细嗅暮色时 直视我的面庞
"Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening.

16
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,760
放心说吧 无人能闻得见 我只多留片刻
"Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer."

17
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,240
我是否自相矛盾？
"Do I contradict myself?

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,770
好吧 那我就自相矛盾
"Very well then, I contradict myself.

19
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,600
我心疆无限 我包罗万象
I am large, I contain multitudes."

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,770
天哪
My God.

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,250
怎么了？
What is it?

22
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,890
什么事让你打断惠特曼的诗？
Clearly something more interesting than Whitman.

23
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,590
是加州 那又地震了
California. There was another earthquake.

24
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,980
从圣巴巴拉到弗雷斯诺一大片地都没了...
A huge chunk's gone from Santa Barbara to Fresno.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,550
-太可怕了 -...沉入大海了
-It's fucking crazy. -Into the ocean.

26
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,370
-就那样没了 -别慌 别慌
-Just like that. -Alright, alright.

27
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,770
{\an8}全没了
9.1级地震袭击加州

28
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,130
{\an8}无网络连接

29
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
冷静
Settle down.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,230
没网了
Got no connection.

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,250
你们有网吗？
Anybody else have one?

32
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,140
没有
No.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,500
抱歉 网还用不了
Oh, eh, sorry. Network's still down.

34
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,870
{\an8}无网络连接

35
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,920
不过 这有纸质文件
I've got his file here, though.

36
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,960
迪伦最近在摸鱼
Uh, Dylan's been diving lately.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,860
这学期他成绩从A和B跌到了D
I mean, this semester, he's gone from As and Bs to Ds.

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,260
你有纸质备份？
You keep hard copies?

39
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,580
当网时好时坏时就开始保存了
When the network started acting up, a lot of us started keeping hard copies.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,630
你觉得这次网还能恢复吗？
What do you think? I mean, you think it's coming back?

41
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,560
我不知道
Well, I don't, I don't know.

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,500
我还记得互联网诞生前的世界
I remember the world before the internet.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,980
没网的惨状不难想象
Why is it so hard to imagine carrying on without it?

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,440
对吧？
It is, though, isn't it?

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
还能恢复网吗？还有戏吗？
How do we go back? How... Can we go back?

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,510
如果这次彻底没戏了怎么活？
What if it's down for good this time?

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,790
还没网
Internet's still down.

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,230
是没网 但别担心
Yeah, but lucky for us,

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,310
我有所有学生的纸质文件
I've got hard copies for each student.

50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,250
我有预感
I think this might be it.

51
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,610
我感觉这次网不会恢复了
I don't think it's coming back this time.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,020
你八成是对的
You might be right.

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,820
但重点是艾米丽 她开始旷课了
But I do think we should talk about Emily.  Her attendance has really fallen off.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,370
她旷课了？
Her attendance?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,870
全球旷工旷课都破天荒了
Absenteeism's at an all-time high all over the world.

56
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,870
医生旷 飞行员旷 警察也旷
We got doctors and pilots and cops

57
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,140
大家都他妈擅离职守
and everyone's just pissing the fuck off, right?

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,920
但你却只想着艾米丽？
But you, you want to talk to us about Emily?

59
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,010
现在还怎么上课？
How are they supposed to study, anyway?

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,140
网络崩溃已经八个月了
Web's been on the fritz for eight months.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
有一半网站都是乱码
Half those sites are just garbled.

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,930
我懂 网坏了
I mean, I get it, sites go dark.

63
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,780
但其他问题呢？
But what about all that other stuff?

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,420
有些网站还好
Like, sites are there,

65
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,580
但都是错字和错误标点
but all the punctuation's wrong. words spelled wrong.

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,030
你能解释吗？
How do you explain that?

67
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,420
我不能
Well, I can't,

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,490
但布莱恩还能来上课
but Brian can still prepare for class.

69
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,560
即便没网 课本都还在啊
I mean, the library's still here. Internet or not.

70
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,540
色情网站没了
Pornhub's down.

71
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,600
安德森老师 你知道吗？
Did you know that, Mr. Anderson?

72
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,440
呃 是啊
Yeah, I, uh,

73
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,590
我 我 我听说了 是的
I, I, I had noticed that. Yeah.

74
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,700
对不起 布瑞给你添麻烦了
Sorry if Bri's been any trouble.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,860
这家就我一人了
It's just me now.

76
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,320
他妈妈跑了 我不知道去哪了
His mom... she left, I don't know where.

77
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,970
听说最近这事常见
That's been happening a lot more I hear,

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,710
人们只是玩失踪
people just ghosting.

79
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,500
她高中那会儿认识个无缘的男友
Hers was some star-crossed boyfriend from high school.

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,100
待在一起有一个月吧
They dated a month.

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,140
那该死的一个月
Goddamn month.

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,030
就为了那一个月 她竟然丢下二十年的感情
She's gonna throw 20 years in the trash to chase down a month.

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,990
我猜她一直藕断丝连他
I guess she never stopped thinking about him.

84
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,860
谁心里没有放不下的人
I guess we've all got someone like that.

85
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,410
我懂 我懂
I mean, I get it,

86
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,670
就像那些穿紫袍说的那样 要真是末日了
if it really is the end, like those kooks in the purple robes say,

87
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,910
最终和谁一起面对呢？
then who do you want to be with for it?

88
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,900
她要抛弃骨肉吗？
But to leave her son?

89
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,840
对了 她说会回来的
Uh, she says she'll be back.

90
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,330
我也不确定
I don't know. Um...

91
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,860
该死的色情网站
Fuckin' Pornhub.

92
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,760
万一永远不回来了呢？
What if that never comes back?

93
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,040
真他妈的倒霉
Fuckin' tragedy.

94
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,110
就算这真是一切的结局
I mean, even if it is the end of all things...

95
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,140
这也提前把我结束了
that's just fuckin' mean.

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,460
-见笑了 -嗯
-Sorry. -Yeah.

97
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:09,240
{\an8}美国新闻 北加州变成废墟

98
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,370
北加州满目疮痍 令人心碎
It's a scene of devastation and heartbreak in California,

99
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,290
救援人员正努力在残骸中搜寻
as rescue workers sift through what remains of the northern portion of the state.

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,160

马蒂·安德森第一次看到那广告牌那天
The day Marty Anderson first saw the billboard

114
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,210
恰巧就在互联网彻底瘫痪前
was just before the internet finally went down for good.

115
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,190
在那之前网时好时坏有八个月了
It had been wobbling for eight months,

116
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,690
但占据头条的是其他事件
but other problems, like fires, earthquakes,

117
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,480
像是大火 地震 鸟和鱼的彻底灭绝
and whole species of birds and fish dying off had taken priority.

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,550
{\an9}...烧到现在 这成为美国史上最严重的山火
 ...till today, thought to be the largest wildfire in United States history.

119
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,450
在过去 马蒂会直接走收费公路
Ordinarily, Marty would've driven by way of the Turnpike bypass,

120
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:15,530
但自奥特溪桥塌了后那条路就走不通了
but that wasn't possible due to the collapse of the bridge over Otter Creek.

121
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,010
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

122
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,250
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

123
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,240
{\an9}由于加州最近的灾难
Well, with what happened in California,

124
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,680
{\an9}内华达州现在是全美人口最多的州
that officially makes Nevada one of the most populous states in the Union now.

125
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,330
{\an9}但需要强调的是...
The thing that must be said here is...

126
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,950
菲莉西娅·戈登是市立医院的护士
Felicia Gordon is a nurse at City General.

127
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,360
最近几周她却更像是名收殓员
Though for the last few weeks, she's felt more like an undertaker.

128
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,680
自夏末以来员工就不断的辞职
The staff, whose numbers have been dwindling since late summer,

129
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,840
大家给自己起名叫“自杀小队”
have begun referring to themselves as the Suicide Squad.

130
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,810
{\an9}稍事休息
We'll be back to talk more about this

131
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,520
{\an9}稍后将带来中西部大火和缺水的最新情况
and, uh, also about the fires in the Midwest, speaking of water scarcity, back after this break.

We'd like to say thank you to Charles Krantz for 39 great years.

Thanks, Chuck.

134
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,020
嘿
Hey.

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,440
听说你又救了一个？
Heard you got another one.

136
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,080
嗯 又一个
Yeah. One more.

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,270
我的没那么幸运 手腕都割烂了 你懂的
Mine wasn't so lucky. Slit wrists, so...

138
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,250
真没办法了
what were we supposed to do really?

139
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,950
听说玛丽露的事了吗？
Hear about Marilou?

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,690
没 怎么了？
No. What about Marilou?

141
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,910
她不干了
She left!

142
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,630
-还记得她前任佩德罗吗？ -记得
-Her ex. Remember Pedro? -Mm-hm.

143
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,610
他冒出来 嘟囔了几句
He showed up, and I don't know what he said to her,

144
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,200
两人牵着手就走了
but she walked out holding his hand.

145
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,940
他们离婚离的有多难熬
And I remember how bad that divorce was.

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,660
-有印象吗？ -嗯 记得
-Do you remember? -Yeah, I remember.

147
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,360
好吧 往事如烟了 他们又拉上了手
Well, I guess that's all bridge water 'cause off she went.

148
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,800
{\an9}...地陷不断出现
...sinkholes that have been opening up.

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,340
现在婚姻都咋样？
I wonder what the stats are.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,740
是分居多还是复合多？
You think more people are splitting up or getting back together?

151
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,080
是结婚多还是离婚多？
I mean, do you think marriage rates are up or divorce rates...

152
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,770
结婚多
Marriages.

153
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,000
-你是个乐天派 -不
-You're an optimist. -No.

154
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,700
离婚周期长 没人会去排这个队
Divorce takes way longer, and I don't think anyone's filing.

155
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
填文件就得半年多 何苦呢？
Why bother? Six months of paperwork at least. Probably more.

156
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,430
结婚领证上下只要一小时
Marriage license is one page and it takes an hour or so.

157
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,230
所以我猜结婚多
I'm gonna guess marriages.

158
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,220
{\an7}午餐不见你 晚餐也不在
Missed you for lunch, missed you for dinner.

159
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,690
{\an9}电影《封面女郎》(1944)

160
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,870
{\an7}怎么了？辟谷了吗？
What's the matter? Don't you eat anymore?

161
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,610
{\an7}好吧 我不饿
Well, I wasn't hungry tonight.

162
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,180
{\an7}那你今早也不饿吗？
Weren't you hungry this morning either?

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,490
{\an7}谁拿了我的舞蹈袜？天哪 谁那么坏
Who stole my nylons? Egads! The very...

164
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,780
菲莉西娅·戈登来电

165
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,180
{\an7}不饿
 Not very.

166
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,500
{\an7}昨晚排练到很晚吗？
Too much rehearsal last night, huh?

167
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,940
{\an7}就像锻炼一样
It was kind of a workout.

168
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,730
{\an7}赖床了？所以今早来的那么晚
That why you slept late?

169
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
{\an7}我可没晚起
Oh, I didn't sleep late.

170
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,990
{\an7}我去了富人区
I went uptown.

171
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,300
{\an7}-去购物？ -不是
-Shopping? -No.

172
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,710
喂
Hey.

173
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,870
喂
Hi.

174
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,770
你给挂了？
You hung up?

175
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,200
是啊
Yeah.

176
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,400
但后来想你看的到 所以又...
But then I figured you probably saw it. So...

177
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,030
还好吗？
How are you?

178
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,600
还行
I'm okay, I guess.

179
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,780
你呢？
How are you?

180
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,650
我上班时想到你了
I was, um, thinking about you today.

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,460
当时在猜结婚多还是离婚多
We were at work talking about marriages and divorces. Like, which are happening more now...

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
我赌结婚多
Marriages, I bet.

183
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,840
没人愿意等离婚
Ain't nobody waiting on a divorce.

184
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,470
那么再婚呢？
What about remarriages?

185
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,420
要约炮得先请我喝酒
You want to buy a guy a drink first or...

186
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,770
我打赌人们都在再复合
I bet those are happening.

187
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,630
这很有意义
I mean, it makes sense.

188
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,150
人们现在渴望慰藉和熟悉的事物
People wanting something comforting and familiar.

189
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,760
那么 你今天过得怎么样？
So... how was your day?

190
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,740
你想复合的意图太明显了 不觉得吗？
You're just going right for it, aren't you?

191
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,020
陪我聊聊
Humor me.

192
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,990
呃 今天就那样
It was, um...It was a day, I guess.

193
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,690
有点怪
You know? Weird.

194
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,350
家长会开的就像对牛弹琴
Parent-teacher sessions, felt like pissing in the wind.

195
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,020
你听说加州的事儿了吧？
You know about California, right?

196
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,790
听说了
Yeah.

197
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,460
我听说大部分人都迁移了
I know they're saying most of it was already evacuated,

198
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,940
今天就有几十万灾民东迁
but I heard today there are hundreds of thousands of refugees trekking east.

199
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,730
知道现在内华达州是全美人口最多的州吗？
Did you know Nevada is one of the most  populous states in the Union now?

200
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,710
听国家电台科学家说 加州就跟烂墙皮一样往下掉
I heard a, a scientist on NPR say California is peeling away like old wallpaper.

201
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,900
今天下午 日本又有一座核电站被淹
And another Japanese reactor got inundated this afternoon.

202
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,220
他们虽说 停机了 一切安全
And they're saying, you know, it was shut down and all's well,

203
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,190
但我就是没法相信
but I just, I, I don't think I believe that.

204
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,410
你真是个怀疑论者
Cynic.

205
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,330
好吧 马蒂 这日子就是这么不靠谱
Well, we're living in cynical times, Marty.

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,010
不少人都认为天要塌了
I mean, some people think we're living in the last times.

207
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,180
不再是邪教成员这样想了
Not just the religious crazies either. Not anymore.

208
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,280
市立医院自杀小队的许多专家也这样说
And you are hearing that from a member in good standing of the City General Suicide Squad.

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,580
那是我们的自称
That's what we call ourselves now.

210
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,180
可没瞎说
No lie.

211
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,890
今天有6人没挺过来 但救回了18人 主要用纳洛酮
We lost six today, but there's 18 more we dragged back, mostly with naloxone.

212
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,500
但这种药已经供不上了
But supplies of that are getting very thin.

213
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,400
我听药房说最多坚持到月底
And I heard the head pharmacist say we might be completely out by the end of the month.

214
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,340
太倒霉了
That sucks.

215
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,100
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,030
是的 太倒霉了 真的太倒霉了
Yeah, that sucks. It, it really sucks.

217
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,480
互联网瘫痪 加州下沉
The internet's down, and California's hanging by a thread.

218
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,650
还有大火 饥荒 疫情和各种灾难
There's fires and famines and plagues and all the rest.

219
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,490
连我们医院也快崩溃了
I mean, it just the center doesn't hold.

220
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,380
有完没完
It just won't let up.

221
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,020
那天还有多久？
How long is this gonna go on?

222
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,410
那之前还能撑多久？
How much can we take before the whole thing...

223
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,660
我是说 天塌下来前
before the whole thing goes apart, I mean.

224
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,530
我在教孩子们卡尔·萨根的理论
I'm teaching the kids Carl Sagan right now.

225
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,530
{\an9}卡尔·萨根是知名的美国天文学家

226
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,480
你听说过他的宇宙历年法吗？
You ever hear what he said about the cosmic calendar?

227
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,080
呃 想不起来 应该没听过
Uh... I don't know. I don't think so.

228
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,340
你知道 宇宙已有150亿年历史
Well, the universe is 15 billion years old.

229
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,240
如果你把这150亿年
And if you took all of that all, all 15 billion years

230
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,400
都给它压缩到365天的日历中
and compress them into a single calendar year,

231
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,250
那么宇宙大爆炸发生在1月1日第一秒
then the Big Bang happens in the first second, January 1st.

232
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,040
{\an8}一月份

233
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,600
而如今
And, and today,

234
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,820
我们正处于12月31日 最后一天的最后一刻
oh, right now, we're in the final millisecond of the last minute of the last day, December 31st.

235
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
{\an8}十二月份

236
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,760
回到起点
But if you go back to the start,

237
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,110
回到大爆炸发生的1月1日夜里
if the, if the Big Bang happens at midnight, January 1st,

238
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,200
日历里每个月等于12.5亿年
then each month of this calendar is one and a quarter billion years long.

239
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,480
嘿 别考我数学
Hey, nobody told me there was math on this exam.

240
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,210
宇宙在1月1日诞生
The universe starts January 1st,

241
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,900
但此时我们的银河系还没形成 形成要到5月
but the, uh, the Milky Way didn't form until May.

242
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,540
{\an8}五月份

243
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,440
我们的太阳和地球 要到9月中旬才形成
Our sun and our earth, they don't show up until mid-September.

244
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,010
{\an8}九月份

245
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,440
生命不久后就有了 但没轮到我们
Life appears soon after. But not us.

246
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,570
猜猜我们什么时候出现的？
No. No, no, we don't appear for guess how long?

247
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,790
再说一遍 今天不考数学
Again, I was told there'd be no math.

248
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,080
在12月31日
December 31st.

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,690
出现在日历上的最后一天
Last day on the calendar,

250
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,750
{\an8}十二月份

251
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:44,310
最早的人类出现在晚上10点半左右
and the very first human beings on Earth made their debut around 10:30 p.m.

252
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,810
出现在最后一天的晚上10点半
10:30 p.m. on the last day.

253
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,200
每一分钟代表着3万年
And, um, every minute since then is 30,000 years.

254
00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:01,860
晚上11:46 距离午夜14分钟 人类才学会用火
So, 11:46 p.m., only 14 minutes ago, humanity tamed fire

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,790
在距离午夜只剩几秒钟时
and now we're out of minutes, we're into seconds.

256
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,830
到11点59分20秒
11:59 and 20 seconds,

257
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,920
动植物才被驯化 人类刚开始能制造工具
the domestication of plants and animals begin, an application for the human talent for making tools.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,270
到11点59分35秒
11:59 and 35 seconds,

259
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,060
农耕社区演变为首批城市雏形
agricultural communities evolved into the first cities.

260
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,020
我们记载的所有历史
Our recorded history,

261
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,760
听说过的所有人
everyone we've ever heard of,

262
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:39,450
所有历史书上的事 都只发生在最后10秒钟里
every single thing in any one of our history books happens in the last 10 seconds.

263
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:47,410
所有事都集中在最后一天最后一分钟的最后十秒
The last 10 seconds of the last minute of the last day on the calendar.

264
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,620
日历的最后一天
December 31st.

265
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,530
该怎么回答你那天还有多久？
So how long is it gonna go on?

266
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,700
我不知道 小菲
I don't know, Fel.

267
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,140
要是你说得对 很可能真是这样
If you're right, and you might be,

268
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,020
这可能就是末世 宇宙正在消亡
that this really is the, the last times and the universe is dying,

269
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,670
就算它在快速消亡
and let's just say it's a fast death,

270
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,020
即使这一切都发生在最后一秒
even if all of this is happening in the, the last split second,

271
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,980
最后一微秒
microsecond,

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,250
谁知道对我们来说是多久
who knows how long that'll last.

273
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,420
也许是几秒钟 也可以是无限长
Maybe seconds, maybe eons.

274
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,860
也许发生在宇宙吐出最后一口气的时候
Maybe all this is happening as the cosmos burps out its last breath.

275
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:36,550
也许发生在宇宙最后一次心跳的时候
Maybe it's all happening in the last single solitary heartbeat.

276
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,940
你真能说 马蒂
Jesus, Marty.

277
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,610
是吧
Yeah.

278
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,790
好了 小菲 我该挂了 我...
Listen, Fel, I should go. I've, um...

279
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,120
还得批改试卷呢
I've got tests to grade.

280
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,340
马蒂
Marty...

281
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,640
一切都完了 我们也只剩下句真倒霉
the world is going down the drain, and all we can say is, "That sucks."

282
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,580
说不定谁都躲不掉这劫
So, maybe we're going down the drain too.

283
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,250
说不定
Maybe.

284
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,730
听说了吗 查克·克兰兹要退休了
But, you know, Chuck Krantz is retiring.

285
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,130
都要天塌下来了 还有这个插曲
So...I guess there's a gleam of light in the darkness.

286
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,760
听说了 39个峥嵘岁月
Yes. Thirty-nine great years.

287
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,440
哦 你也看到那个奇葩的广告牌了？
Oh, you saw that weird billboard?

288
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,440
不 是从收音机里听到的广告
No, it was an ad on the radio that, um,

289
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,350
之前跟你讲的那个国家电台
that NPR show I was telling you about.

290
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,680
国资电台都开始打广告了 这真是世界末日了
If they're running ads on NPR, it really is the end of the world.

291
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,620
查克·克兰兹会怎么计算广告覆盖率
Tell me, how does Chuck Krantz rate this kind of coverage?

292
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,150
我是说 他像个会计师
I mean... looks like an accountant.

293
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,250
我从没听说过他
I've never heard of him.

294
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,200
广告一定用了张老照片
Used an old photo too, I guess.

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,420
他看着都不到40 咋来的40年工龄
I mean, the guy barely looks 40 at all, let alone 40 years on the job.

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
无奇不有
The world is full of mysteries.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,030
嘿 马蒂 别喝烈酒了
And, hey, no hard stuff, Marty.

298
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,470
喝点啤酒吧
Okay? Have a beer instead.

299
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,630
遵命
You got it.

300
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,370
俄州环保局对克利夫兰一带下达了空气红色警报
The Ohio EPA has now issued a code red air quality alert for Cleveland and its surrounding...

301
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,360
{\an8}俄州山火蔓延 克利夫兰居民紧急疏散
（滚动新闻：余震后加州海岸线不断下沉）

302
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,520
{\an8}电影《封面女郎》(1944)

303
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,780
{\an8}信号中断

304
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,160
{\an8}信号中断

305
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,810
{\an8}信号中断

306
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,580
我勒个去
Shit on a stick.

307
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,240
感谢查尔斯·查克·克兰兹39年来的峥嵘岁月
We'd like to say thank you to Charles Krantz for 39 great years.

308
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,100
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹

309
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,800
谢谢你 查克
Thanks, Chuck.

310
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:50,450
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

311
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,650
{\an8}信号中断

312
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
格斯
Gus!

313
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,660
哦 嘿 马蒂
Oh. Hey, Marty.

314
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,970
怎么不开车了？
Where's your car?

315
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,300
车 车停在半山腰了 好几百辆车都扔路上了
It's... it's on, it's on the sidewalk halfway down Main Street Hill with a hundred others.

316
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,870
我只好步行
I finally just had to turn around.

317
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,690
该死 我走了
Fuck it, I walked...

318
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,220
猜我走了多远？ 这有五公里了吧？
What do you think it is, like, three miles?

319
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,180
我走了将近五公里
I just walked three miles.

320
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,390
哦 你是这要去学校吧 等下
Oh, you're going to school. Hold on a sec.

321
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,220
呃 我想下 你得绕 你得绕
Uh, real quick, you gotta, you gotta go,

322
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,230
你得绕道走11号公路
listen to me, you gotta go out Route 11

323
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,580
然后在转到19号公路
and then hook back on, on, on 19.

324
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
是呀 路上会很堵
Yeah. There's gonna be plenty of traffic.

325
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,320
你大概得绕至少30公里
You gotta go out at least 20 miles.

326
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,800
运气好中午能到
You might make it before lunch.

327
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,240
-别指望早到 -发生了什么事？
-I wouldn't count on it. -What happened?

328
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,460
市场街和主街交叉那有大地坑
Giant sinkhole opened up on Market and Main.

329
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,550
老兄 陷得太大了
Man, the-the thing, it, uh, it's huge.

330
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,810
要么是降雨导致的
All the rain probably had something to do with it,

331
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,590
要么是缺乏维护
lack of maintenance maybe more so.

332
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,900
至少轮不到我去修
But it's not my department, thank God.

333
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,950
但是 坑下面得有二十多辆车吧
But, yeah, there's, there's gotta be 20 cars at the bottom.

334
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,340
那些车里的人 永远上不来了
And some of the people in some of those cars, they ain't comin' back.

335
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,210
老天 我昨天下班就堵在那里
Jesus, I was, I was just there last night,

336
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,740
堵在那好久
backed up in traffic.

337
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,520
幸好你今早不在那里
Thank God you weren't there this morning.

338
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,130
听说加州的事了吧
I assume you know about California.

339
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,830
我今早没看电视
I didn't turn on the TV this morning.

340
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,050
-难怪 -有什么新闻吗？
-Oh! -Is there something new?

341
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,010
都沉下去了
The, the rest of it went.

342
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,530
电视说北加州20%还尚存
I-I mean, th-they're saying that 20% of Northern California is hanging in there,

343
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,320
实际也许还剩10%
which probably means, what, 10%?

344
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,240
但是粮食产区都没了
But the food-producing regions are... they're gone.

345
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,190
中西部被烧成个焦土
And with the Midwest turning to charcoal

346
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,890
佛州又被水淹
and Florida flooding, that's like

347
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,370
全国粮仓都没了
all the food-producing regions in the country just gone.

348
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,770
欧洲的情况也差不多
And the same thing with Europe.

349
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,330
亚洲也在闹饥荒
I mean, it's famine time in Asia.

350
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,770
听说那死了一百万人
There's a million people dead.

351
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,370
他们管它叫做 树 树疫
They're saying it's the bub-bublonic,

352
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,600
-树疫病 -鼠疫
-bubonic plague. -Bubonic.

353
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,560
对 鼠疫
Bu-Bubonic plague. Yeah.

354
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,860
还有蜜蜂 十多年前就不正常
And the bees, I mean, they were in trouble a decade ago,

355
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,340
但现在所有蜜蜂都没了
but they're completely gone now.

356
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,040
也许南美洲还有几个蜂巢吧
I mean, there's a couple of hives or whatever down in South America,

357
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,960
但不产蜂蜜
but there ain't no honey, honey.

358
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,740
没有这些小虫虫 怎么给剩下的庄稼授粉呢
And without those little guys, like, what's gonna pollinate all the crops we have left?

359
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,790
要我说 我可...
I mean, I can't do...

360
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,140
先打住 稍后聊
Excuse me. One sec.

361
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,440
哦 哦 好
Yeah, yeah. That's-that's cool.

362
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,310
是 安 安德莉娅吗？
A-Andrea? Are you,

363
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,190
你是中西部信托银行的安德莉娅吗？
are you Andrea from Midwest Trust?

364
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,230
我是菲莉西娅·安德森的丈夫
I'm Felicia Anderson's husband.

365
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,410
实际上 是前夫
Ex, actually.

366
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,930
我觉得你和小菲互相认识
I think you and Fel know each other.

367
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,720
我们之前在大卫家聚会时见过
We met at a, a, a game night at David's.

368
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,830
几晚游戏聚会
A few game nights.

369
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,200
对 记得
Yeah, sure.

370
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,810
你想干什么？
What do you want?

371
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,070
车堵在路上 我刚走了半天
I just had a long walk, and my car is stuck,

372
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,420
而银行 斜了
and the bank is, it's leaning.

373
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,830
斜了？
Leaning?

374
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,240
是的
Yeah.

375
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,240
银行就在地坑旁边
It's on the edge of the sinkhole.

376
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,990
估计我的职业生涯到此为止
Guess that's the end of my job.

377
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,170
嘿 你们银行上头那广告牌是啥意思
Hey, I'm curious about the billboard on the bank building.

378
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,480
-你看到了吗？ -怎么能躲得过？
-Have you seen it? -How could I miss it?

379
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,860
那广告还出现在电视上
And I saw the ads too, on TV.

380
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,210
电视不再播卖车卖家具的广告了
No more ads for cars or discount furniture.

381
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,610
只播“感谢查尔斯·克兰兹39年来的峥嵘岁月 谢谢你 查克”
Just, "Charles Krantz, 39 great years. Thanks, Chuck."

382
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,530
他不是你银行的人？
So, he doesn't work at the bank?

383
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,400
他不是从你银行退休？
He's not retiring from the bank?

384
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,100
我根本不认识这个人
I don't know Charles Krantz.

385
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,930
我觉得这就是个恶搞 玩行为艺术
I think it's just a prank. Performance art.

386
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,510
你保重
Take care.

387
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,510
他们看起来像是灾民
They look like refugees.

388
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,710
是啊
Yeah.

389
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,390
至少大家不再惊慌失措了
No one looks that concerned.

390
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,170
那又怎样？
What good would that do?

391
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,690
刚开始大家都惊慌失措
All was concerned at the start.

392
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,520
还记得那些抗议吗？
Remember the protests?

393
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,390
还记得他们推倒白宫的围栏吗？
You remember they knocked over the fence at the White House,

394
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,310
记得他们向那些学生开枪吗？
and all those students got shot?

395
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,050
-是的 -还有俄罗斯政府被推翻
-Yeah. -And the overthrow of the Russian government.

396
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,660
巴基斯坦和印度间的四日战争
You got the Four Day War between Pakistan and India

397
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,970
还有他妈的德国火山喷发
and the fucking... the volcano in Germany.

398
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,440
德国火山还能喷发 太扯了
There was a volcano in Germany. That's, that's crazy.

399
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,980
我们自我安慰 一切都会过去的
And we just kept saying, "Oh, it's gonna blow over."

400
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,690
看来过不去的 对吧？
That doesn't look to be happening, though, does it?

401
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,460
是啊
No.

402
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,330
我觉得自杀的人最终会减少
I think that suicides will slow down.

403
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,950
我觉得人们最终会等待
I think people will just...wait.

404
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,080
等什么？
For what?

405
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,150
等结局
The end.

406
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,020
万物的大结局
This is the end of everything.

407
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,110
我们正处在悲伤模型第五阶段
I mean, we're, we're going through the five stages of grief.

408
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:16,750
{\an9}库伯勒-罗丝悲伤模型五阶段：否认 愤怒 恳求 沮丧 接受

409
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,460
你明白吗？我们到了最后阶段
Don't you get it? I mean, we just, we just landed on the final stage.

410
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,500
接受
Acceptance.

411
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,380
等待 才是最难熬的
The waiting...I think that's the hardest part.

412
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,630
灾难不打声招呼就冒出来了
And the whole thing, it just, it-it came out of nowhere, right?

413
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,290
我是说 大家早知道有自然环境问题
I mean, everyone knew there was trouble with the environment.

414
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,810
即便是右翼疯子也私下里心知肚明
I mean, I think even the right-wing nutjobs were secretly, they got it.

415
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,390
但现在
But this...

416
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,330
现在这些
this...

417
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,430
现在这些不过是各种屁事的集合
this is just 60 different varieties of shit.

418
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,910
屁事来的太快了
It's just so much shit that happened fast.

419
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,180
现在一年都十四个月了
It's like a year, man. Fourteen months.

420
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,040
倒霉啊
Sucks.

421
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,520
是啊 倒霉啊
Yeah. Sucks.

422
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,630
飞机写字
Skywriting.

423
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,190
长大后就再也没见过这种事
I haven't seen one of those since I was a kid.

424
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,810
{\an8}谢谢你 亠亠

425
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,080
搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

426
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,570
我也想问同样的问题
My sentiments... exactly.

427
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,710
{\an8}谢谢你 查克

428
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,180
{\an8}谢谢你 查克！

429
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,830
{\an8}街头艺人万岁

430
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,060
{\an8}查克万岁

431
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,690
{\an8}查克我爱你

432
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,130
{\an8}查克yyds

433
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,080
{\an8}爱你查克

434
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,420
喂 喂 喂  你上哪去了？
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where have you been?

435
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,730
你不知道吗？我跑过来的
Are you kidding? I had to run here.

436
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,780
路全堵了 一半人把车都仍路上了
The traffic's insane, and half the cars are empty.

437
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,910
温斯顿医生跑了
Dr. Winston's MIA.

438
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,600
-什么意思？ -你没听错
-What? -Yeah.

439
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,950
他今天早上过来看了一圈转头就走了
He walked in this morning, and he looked around and he walked out again.

440
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,480
再也找不到他了
And now I can't find him.

441
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,440
他把对讲机都扔门口了
He dropped his pager when he walked out.

442
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,740
好 那我来开刀
Okay. I'll scrub in.

443
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,090
床位都空了
The beds are empty.

444
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,680
病人基本都自己走出去了 我把最后一个扶出去的
Most of them walked out. I-I-I transferred the last of the stable ones.

445
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,090
但是 菲莉西娅 有点怪事
But, Felicia, there's something weird.

446
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,570
怎么回事？
What is that?

447
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,460
机子坏了吗？
What's wrong with the monitor?

448
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,410
这就是怪事 不只这一台
That's the thing, it-it's, it's not just that one.

449
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,110
我搞不懂 小菲 搞不懂
I don't know, Fel. I don't know.

450
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,590
我 我也不想待在这了
I mean... I might want to get out of here.

451
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,850
我想回家
I might wanna go home.

452
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,090
没必要再待在这了
I don't think I need to be here anymore.

453
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,660
{\an8}信号中断

454
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,120
{\an8}菲莉西娅

455
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,190
{\an8}呼出失败 无信号

456
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,170
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹

457
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,320
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！

458
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,780
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

459
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,630
还好吗 老先生？
You okay, sir?

460
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,000
好 就歇歇脚
Yeah. Just taking a rest.

461
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,880
我走去市中心看大地坑了
I walked downtown to look at the sinkhole

462
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,930
还用手机拍了几张照片
and take a few pictures with my phone.

463
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,280
我以为电视台可能会想要
Thought one of the local TV stations might be interested,

464
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,540
但全都停播了
but they all seem to be off the air.

465
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,670
除了克兰兹的广告
Except for pictures of Krantz.

466
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,090
到处都是克兰兹啊
All Krantz all the time.

467
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,290
-知道他是谁吗？ -不知道
-Any idea who he is? -None.

468
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,650
我问过至少二十多人 没人知道
I've asked two dozen people, at least. Nobody knows.

469
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,130
我们的克兰兹可是世界末日的领路人啊
Our man, Krantz, is the Oz of the apocalypse.

470
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,910
最后的笑话
Our last meme.

471
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,310
-你往哪走？ -丰收里
-Where are you heading? -Harvest Acres.

472
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,610
世外桃源般的小区
Nice little enclave off the beaten track.

473
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,040
我正要去那儿
I'm heading there myself.

474
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,530
-我前妻住那儿 -噢
-My ex lives there. -Huh.

475
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,820
好吧
Well...

476
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,250
要一起去吗？
I can walk with you if you like.

477
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,540
山姆 你做什么工作的？
What do you do, Sam?

478
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,950
如果还有工作的话
If you still do anything, I mean.

479
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,420
亚伯勒殡仪馆的老板兼首席殡葬师
Owner and chief undertaker for Yarborough Funeral Home.

480
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,980
噢 老天
Oh, man!

481
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
是啊
Yeah.

482
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,680
生意之前好到爆
We had a boom.

483
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,990
谈起这个就高兴
It's hard to feel good about it,

484
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,380
最火的还是前几周
but business was never better than it was a few weeks ago.

485
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,780
但我真正志向所在是气象学
But my real interest's meteorology.

486
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,210
年轻时我曾想当电视上天气预报员
Dreamed of being a television weatherman in my salad days,

487
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,780
也许能成全国台的
maybe even one of the networks.

488
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,050
但 没成
But n-no.

489
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,960
不过还继续关注着
I keep up, though.

490
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,530
读有关的书
Read the journals.

491
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:52,100
想听的话 有些我读到的奇闻异事
And I can tell you something amazing if you want to hear.

492
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,110
大家都说一天有24小时 对吧？
You know how people say there are 24 hours in a day?

493
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,040
其实他们错了
Well, they're wrong.

494
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:06,550
在恒星日中一天有23小时零56分钟
There were 23 hours and 56 minutes in a stellar day.

495
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:15,880
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

496
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,320
还零几秒钟
Plus a few odd seconds.

497
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,020
你说的是过去吧？
There "were"?

498
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,160
根据我的计算
Based on my calculations,

499
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,930
相信我 我的数学很好
which I assure you I can back up, my math is good,

500
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,400
现在一天有24小时零2分钟长
there are now 24 hours and two minutes in a day.

501
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,270
知道这什么意思？
Do you know what that means?

502
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,440
地球自转速度在减慢？
Well, you're saying the Earth's rotation is slowing down?

503
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,440
没错
Exactly.

504
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,190
很多人将这些灾难归咎于我们破坏环境
Lot of folks think all of these disasters are 'cause of what we've done to the environment.

505
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,950
并非如此
Not so.

506
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,630
我先承认 我们对待母亲非常坏
I'm the first to admit, we treated our mother,

507
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,420
是的 地球母亲 万物之母
yes, she's our mother, all of us, very badly.

508
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,680
我们肯定玷污了她 几近强暴
Certainly molested her, if not outright raped her.

509
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:56,860
但比起宇宙那浩瀚机制 我们只不过是一粒尘埃
But... we're puny compared to the great clock of the universe.

510
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,120
是呀
No.

511
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
不论是什么原因
Whatever's happening

512
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,870
问题绝对比环境恶化更大
is much larger than environmental degradation.

513
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,570
这就是数学告诉我的
The math says so.

514
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,530
数学能做很多事
And, and math can do a lot of things.

515
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:16,340
数学可以是门艺术 但数学可不会撒谎
I mean, math can be art... but it can't lie.

516
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,800
{\an8}丰收里小区

517
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,240
你看 我要先坐会儿
You know what? I think I'll sit

518
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:32,940
边欣赏日落 边歇歇脚
and enjoy the sunset while I wait for the arthritis to settle a bit.

519
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,250
要一起坐会儿吗？
You care to join me?

520
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,180
我还想继续走
I think I'll go on.

521
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,820
你前妻 我理解
The ex. I understand.

522
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,200
好的 一路顺风 安德森先生
Well, it was nice speaking with you, Mr. Anderson.

523
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,720
你好
Hey.

524
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,680
你好
Hey.

525
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:39,180
别怕 我正去我前妻那儿 菲莉西娅·安德森
Don't worry. I'm going to see my ex-wife, Felicia Anderson.

526
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
她现在改回娘家姓戈登了
I think she's back to Gordon now.

527
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,970
她住在费恩巷19号
She lives on Fern Lane, number 19.

528
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,420
是的 我认识戈登小姐
Yeah, I know Miss Gordon.

529
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,230
你大晚上出来干嘛？
What are you doing out?

530
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,950
溜旱冰
I wanted to go skating.

531
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,640
以前我特别喜欢溜旱冰
I used to love skating.

532
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,790
那现在就该就去溜
Then you should go skating.

533
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,510
也许我真该去溜
Maybe I should.

534
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,600
你都跟戈登小姐分手了 咋还去见她？
Why do you see Miss Gordon if she's your ex?

535
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,560
我还是喜欢她
I still like her.

536
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,060
你们吵架吗？
Do you fight?

537
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,960
以前吵
We used to.

538
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,050
分手后 我们相处得更好了
We get along better now that we're exes.

539
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,380
戈登小姐有时会来送她烤的姜饼干
Miss Gordon gives us gingersnap cookies sometimes.

540
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,200
我其实更喜欢奥利奥 不过...
I like Oreos better, but...

541
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,070
就像是盒巧克力 不能每颗都合心意 对吧？
That's just the way the cookie crumbles, right?

542
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,640
姜饼干里没巧克力
Gingersnaps don't crumble.

543
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,850
除非和奥利奥一起吃...
At least not until you crunch them...

544
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,540
你抓紧回家吧
You better go home, I guess.

545
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,620
没路灯 天太黑 没法溜
It's too dark for skating without streetlights.

546
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,230
会没事吗？
Is everything gonna be okay?

547
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,880
当然会
Sure it is.

548
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,130
{\an8}谢谢你 查克！

549
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,920
回家去
Go home.

550
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,860
回家去找你爸妈
Go home to your Mom and Dad.

551
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,560
抓紧
Do it now.

552
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,450
哦 谢天谢地 谢天谢地
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

553
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,640
-谢天谢地 -这些都 都...
-Thank God. -They, they just...

554
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,090
这些都突然冒出来了
They just, they just started showing up.

555
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,810
我知道 我知道 我也看到了
No, I know, I know, I saw.

556
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,970
只是这个小区吗？
Is it just here?

557
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,440
我觉得到处都有
I think it's everywhere.

558
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,330
看起来时候到了
I think it's almost...

559
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,430
是啊
Yeah...

560
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,860
是的 时候到了
Yeah, I think it's almost...

561
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,780
这是我见过的最亮的星空
It's the brightest I've ever seen the stars.

562
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,450
看那里
Just look at that.

563
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,230
那是天鹰座
There's Aquila the eagle.

564
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,680
嗯
Mm-hm.

565
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,420
那是...
There's, uh...

566
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,950
天鹅座
Cygnus the swan.

567
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,750
你看到了吗？
You see it?

568
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,970
那是北极...
And there's the North Sta...

569
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,700
你看到刚才那个吗？
Did you just see that?

570
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,340
看到了
Yeah.

571
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,720
火星也没了
There goes Mars.

572
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,510
我好怕
I'm scared.

573
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,340
我也是
I am too.

574
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,920
没事的 亲爱的
It's okay, honey.

575
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,880
你先走一步
You go on.

576
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,610
我们到那里再重逢
You go on ahead, okay?

577
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,440
活了才39年
Just thirty-nine years.

578
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,640
是39个峥嵘岁月
Thirty-nine great years.

579
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,150
谢谢你 查克
Thanks, Chuck.

580
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,420
我爱...
I love y...

581
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,500
{\an8}第二幕

582
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,690
{\an8}第二幕
街头艺人万岁

583
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,410
多亏她那开着旧面包车的朋友麦克帮忙
With the help of her friend, Mac, who has an old van,

584
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,820
泰勒·弗兰克才能把架子鼓摆到
Taylor Franck sets up her drum kit in

585
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,110
第八街长廊上她最喜欢的那个地方
her favored spot on the Eighth Street Promenade.

586
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,180
这天是周四下午
It's Thursday afternoon.

587
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,050
这天的天气 真是绝了
The weather is fucking gorgeous,

588
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,100
街上人来人往 大家都在幻想着周末
and the streets are thronged with people looking forward to the weekend,

589
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,060
毕竟幻想总比现实好
which is always better than the weekend itself.

590
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,540
-泰勒 都差不多了吧？ -嗯 谢了
-All good. Taylor? -Yeah, thanks.

591
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,500
老铁 别忘分我一成收入
Ten percent is all the thanks I want, dude.

592
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:00,950
泰勒和麦克都在城堡街的心疗唱片店打零工
Taylor, and Mac too, work part-time at Doctor Records on Castle Street.

593
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,150
打赏多时 泰勒挣得差不多跟打零工一样
But on a good day Taylor can make almost as much busking.

594
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,340
{\an8}魔术帽
每笔打赏都会精彩翻倍

595
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,810
当初考上茱莉亚时 她爸妈可没料到她会上街打鼓
Busk-drumming isn't what her parents saw for her when she enrolled at Juilliard,

596
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:20,080
{\an9}茱莉亚学院是世界顶尖的音乐学校

597
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,020
更不知道她现在还辍了学
and they don't know yet that she dropped out.

598
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,680
在茱莉亚他们教你多动脑子
Juilliard wanted you to think about what you were doing,

599
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:29,940
在泰勒眼里 跟着鼓点走就对了 多想一下灵感就跑了
but as far as Taylor is concerned, the beat is your friend and thinking is the enemy.

600
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,410
她先热身 一开始节奏简单
She starts warming up, going easy at first.

601
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,200
节奏缓慢 不敲牛铃
slow tempo, no cowbell,

602
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,600
不在乎魔术帽空着 里面只有她自己放的钱
not minding that the magic hat stays empty except for her two crumpled dollars

603
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,390
还有个滑板小子随随便便丢进去的硬币
and a quarter flipped contemptuously by a dude on a skateboard.

604
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,210
时间还早 总能找到切入点
There is time. There is a way in.

605
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:00,520
找到切入点才是占最大头的乐趣
Finding the in is half the fun. Maybe even most of it.

606
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:07,270
珍妮丝·哈利迪在书店工作一天后正在回家
Janice Halliday is on her way home from seven hours at Paper and Page,

607
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,450
大概会去海边走走
and may walk all the way to the ocean.

608
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,100
谈了一年多的男友刚甩了她
Her boyfriend of 16 months just broke up with her,

609
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,570
随便发个消息甩了她
and he did it the modern way.

610
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,700
{\an7}女：怎么不回我消息了？
男：咱俩不合适 你是个好人 继续做朋友？？

611
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,980
王八蛋！
Motherfucker!

612
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,030
这突如其来 犹如当头一棒把门关在脸上
It was totally unexpected, like having a door slammed in your face just as you were getting ready to walk through it.

613
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,590
-那感觉... -真他妈离谱
-It was... -Fucking bullshit!

614
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,160
...真他妈离谱
...fucking bullshit.

615
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,430
她从没动过真情 也没天真地以为自己爱过他
She isn't in love with him. never even kidded herself that she was.

616
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,300
-但依然... -他喵的糟透了
-But still it... -Fucking sucks.

617
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,610
...打她个措手不及
...is a dismaying shock just the same.

618
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:42,650
她打算回家后喝点酒 顺便哭一场
She supposes she'll have some wine when she gets home and cry.

619
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,090
说不定还会播个爵士乐 在屋里醉舞一番
Maybe queue up one of her big band playlists and dance drunk around the room.

620
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,880
她读高中时就爱跳舞
She loved to dance in high school.

621
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,800
也许能借此重温当年那份快乐
Maybe she can recapture a little of that happiness.

622
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,030
-去你妈的 -说什么？
-Fucking really?! -Excuse me.

623
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,520
对不起 对不起 没说你 没说你
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Not you, not you.

624
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,960
他喵的！
Fuck!

625
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,520
查克的拿铁好了
Got an oat milk latte for Chuck.

626
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,650
{\an8}查克 ^v^

627
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,320
查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
Charles Krantz,

628
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,330
在朋友眼中 他总一身会计行头
Chuck to his friends, is dressed in the armor of accountancy.

629
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,950
灰西装 蓝衬衣配蓝领带
Gray suit, blue shirt, blue tie.

630
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,950
脚上那双温莎牌皮鞋虽不贵 却耐穿
His Samuel Windsor shoes are inexpensive but sturdy.

631
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:26,220
他来这参加个主题为“二十一世纪银行业”的研讨会
He's here for a week-long conference titled "Banking in the 21st Century."

632
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,960
他的中西部信托银行派他来的
He's been sent by his bank, Midwest Trust,

633
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,880
全程报销
all expenses paid.

634
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,750
查克对嘉宾和座谈都挺有兴趣
Chuck has enjoyed the speakers and the panels.

635
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,320
他上过一个座谈会
He was on one panel

636
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,370
明天中午大会结束前还要再参加一个
and is scheduled to be on another before the conference ends at noon tomorrow,

637
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:48,760
但他可不想下班后还和那群同行混在一起
but has no wish to spend his off-duty hours in the company of 70 other accountants.

638
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,120
他精通会计的那套行话 也觉得自己能融入别的圈子
He speaks their language, but likes to think he speaks others as well.

639
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,940
至少曾经那么自信 如今却大不如前了
At least he did, although some of the vocabulary is now lost.

640
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,000
现在 他穿着他温莎牌牛津鞋正在午后散步
Now, his sensible Samuel Windsor Oxfords are taking him for an afternoon walk.

641
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,050
现在的生活没能达到最初的设想
His life is narrower than the one he once hoped for,

642
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,410
可他已经释然了
but he's made peace with that.

643
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,790
他明白水往低处流是自然规律
He understands that narrowing is the natural order of things.

644
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,410
他有个忠贞不渝的妻子叫珍妮
He has a wife, Ginny,to whom he is scrupulously faithful,

645
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,540
还有个聪明风趣的儿子上初中
and an intelligent, good-humored son in middle school.

646
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,190
他还有九个月可活 只不过他还不知道
He also has only nine months to live, though he doesn't know that yet.

647
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:43,940
泰勒已经敲了十分钟了 分文未得 毫无灵感
Taylor has been on the job for 10 minutes now and has nothing to show for it.

648
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,910
她看见个西装男朝她走来
She sees a Mr. Businessman type coming toward her

649
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,430
不知为何 他身上有股气息
and something about him, God knows what,

650
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,520
让泰勒忍不住大张旗鼓宣布他登场了
makes Taylor want to announce his approach.

651
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,060
她先用松弛的摇摆热场 又切换到更撩人的节奏
She slips first into a reggae beat, then something slinkier.

652
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,400
今天头一次 泰勒火花被点燃
And for the first time today, Taylor feels a spark

653
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,670
便在核心鼓点上敲着牛铃
and begins to whack the cowbell on the downbeat.

654
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,100
真带感
It's pretty cool.

655
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,920
鼓点已经到来 那律动带你一路向前
The groove has arrived, and the groove is like a road you want to follow.

656
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,680
她本可把节拍提快 玩点花样
She could speed the beat up, get some tom in there,

657
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,170
但此刻目光是那西装男 多此一举反而不搭
but she's watching Mr. Businessman and that seems wrong for this dude.

658
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,690
她以为那西装男只是路过 要去商务酒店
She believes Mr. Businessman will just go on past on his way to the business hotel,

659
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,870
等他一走 泰勒再换节拍
and when he's gone, Taylor will switch to something else.

660
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,030
可他却停下脚步
But instead of floating on by...

661
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,100
赏个脸
Come on.

662
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,020
来吧 小老妹
Come on, little sister.

663
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,720
跳个舞吧
Let's dance.

664
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,260
跳
Dance.

665
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,440
对了
Yeah!

666
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,060
我带你跳 有我别怕
I'll lead you. I got you.

667
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,880
啊
Uh.

668
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,250
没事 眼镜的事儿 眼镜的事儿
It's okay. It's my glasses. It's my glasses.

669
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,990
现在该做什么？
What are we doing?

670
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,820
我也不知道
I don't know.

671
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,690
大伙 今天就到这了
No more today, folks.

672
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
今天就到这了
No more today.

673
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,250
今天就到这了 得见好就收
No more today. We gotta quit while we're ahead.

674
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,820
{\an8}魔术帽
每笔打赏都会精彩翻倍

675
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,290
要搭把手吗
Do you need a-any help at all or...

676
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,810
好 帮把这个收起来
Here, can you, uh, take this?

677
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,420
-好 -拧这里
-Sure. -Just, just spin the thingy here.

678
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,470
-小心别夹手了 -会雨过天晴的
But watch out for your fingers. -It'll, it'll, it'll get 'em good.

679
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,300
懂了吧
you know what I mean?

680
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,500
-好 好 -找点事散散心
-Yeah, yeah. -To doing something else.

681
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,690
刚太神奇了
What just happened?

682
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,690
跳的太神了
That was incredible.

683
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,130
你们是舞蹈演员吗？
You dance for a living?

684
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,870
哦 不 不
No. Oh, no. I...

685
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,870
-不 不是的 -你做什么的？
-No, I do not, sir. -What do you do for a living?

686
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,850
哎呦 我好像不小心搞坏了
Oh, no, I think I... Did I... I didn't break it, did I?

687
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,070
这个好像坏了
I think he broke it.

688
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,840
去喷泉吧
Let's hit the pond.

689
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,170
那儿没停车位
We'll never find parking by the Common.

690
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,570
那也要停
We will today.

691
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,190
今天 就像魔术一样
Today...is magic.

692
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,470
你们在哪练的这身舞功？
Where did you learn to dance like that?

693
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,400
别 别 别 那是你赚的
Oh, no, no, no, that's yours.

694
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,010
不 有福同享
Nope, we split it even.

695
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,470
要我自己敲 一天也赚不了这么多
By myself, I wouldn't have made half as much if I drummed till midnight.

696
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,610
你没事吧？
You okay?

697
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,340
还好
Yeah.

698
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,690
就是有点头疼
Yeah. Just one of my headaches.

699
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,820
不了 不了 真用不着 你留着吧
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. I don't need it. You keep it.

700
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,260
来吧 老兄 你应得的
Come on, man, you earned it.

701
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:55,000
拿去吃顿饭 转手送人也行 但这钱我偏要交给你
Buy yourself dinner. Give it away. But I'm handing it to you.

702
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,400
你们干这行都能当职业了
You could do this for a living, you know?

703
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,360
我可不敢这么说
I don't know about that.

704
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,300
我真觉得靠街头表演 我们能红 能赚大钱
I really think we could busk our way to fame and fortune.

705
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,830
你怎么会停在我面前？
What made you stop in front of me?

706
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,620
又为什么突然跳起舞？
Why did you start moving?

707
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,470
他本可说鼓点让他想起他那不成气候的追旧青年乐队
He could say it was because he was thinking about his old half-assed band, The Retros,

708
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:29,370
他还喜欢跟着节奏跳舞
and how he liked to dance across the stage during instrumental breaks.

709
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,160
但他没这么说
But that's not it.

710
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,760
我也说不清
I don't know.

711
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,960
泰勒 该走了
Taylor, we gotta roll,

712
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,450
不然你赚的钱都得交罚单了
or you're gonna end up spending your take on my parking ticket.

713
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,060
你们不考虑转行跳舞吗？
So, you guys don't want a career change?

714
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,970
转行？
Career change? How... I mean...

715
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,280
我们肯定能闯出名堂
We'll make a name for ourselves.

716
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,980
别急着走 先进来一下
You got to get in here before you go.

717
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,070
-来个大团抱！ -哦 哦 好
-Group hug. -Oh, oh, okay.

718
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,400
-大团抱！ -来
-Group hug. -Okay.

719
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,980
快 快 快
Go.

720
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,600
来 来
Come on.

721
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,860
街头艺人万岁
Buskers forever.

722
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,430
好了 好了
Yeah. Buskers forever.

723
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,690
得赶在贴罚单前抓紧走
We gotta roll before the meter maid shows up.

724
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,610
真替你难过
I'm so sorry.

725
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,310
真倒霉
That sucks.

726
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,290
这确实倒霉
It does suck.

727
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,880
我真觉得他人还不错
I thought he was a nice guy.

728
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,420
床上功夫也到位 我们在一起挺开心的
He was a pretty good lover, and we had fun and all that.

729
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,370
我回去得找下我们跳舞的视频 估计会上热搜
If I can find a video of us dancing, which I'm gonna look because I bet we go viral,

730
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:44,940
然后转发给他 再附句“这就是你错过的缘分”
I'm gonna send it to him with a text, a text that says, "This is what you're missing."

731
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,680
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

732
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,710
我不是全都懂 可这件事我很清楚
I don't know a lot, but I know that much.

733
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:07,640
光辉就在你前面 往前迈一步乌云就消散
You got a bright sunbeam in front of you, and you're gonna step right into it, I can tell.

734
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,240
但现在
But yeah.

735
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,350
真倒霉 没啥好说的
It sucks. Not much else to say.

736
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,020
一切都完了 我们也只剩下句真倒霉
Everything goes down the drain, and all we can say is, "That sucks."

737
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,220
对
Yeah.

738
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,940
说不定谁都躲不掉这劫
Maybe we're going down the drain too.

739
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,640
说不定
Maybe.

740
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,420
我走这条路
I'm this way.

741
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,390
我往那边走
Uh, I'm that way.

742
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,620
多谢你陪我跳舞
Thank you for the dance.

743
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,360
当他走过泰勒摆鼓的地方
As he passes the place where Taylor set up her drums,

744
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,430
那两个问题又冒了出来
those two questions recur.

745
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,280
为什么要停下脚步听？
Why did he stop to listen?

746
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,270
又为什么要跳起舞？
And why did he start to dance?

747
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,130
他自己也想不通
He doesn't know.

748
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:06,210
就算真有答案能够让这段回忆更动人吗？
And would answers make a good thing better?

749
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,910
后来 他走路都成问题
Later, he'll lose the ability to walk,

750
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,740
和那个小老妹跳舞成了个传说
never mind dancing with little sister on the promenade.

751
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,140
再后来 他咀嚼都成了难题
Later, he'll lose the ability to chew food.

752
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,190
再后来 他记不住妻子的名字
Later, he'll forget his wife's name.

753
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:29,150
到最后 他分不清白日黑夜
Later, he'll lose his grip on the difference between waking and sleeping

754
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:38,160
陷入一种让人质疑生命意义的巨大痛苦中
and enter a land of pain so great he will wonder why God made the world.

755
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:45,080
但有时 他还会记得当初把公文包一丢
What he will remember, occasionally, is how he stopped and dropped his briefcase

756
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,690
跟着鼓点起舞的感觉
and began to move his hips to the beat of the drums.

757
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,830
他会觉得 这就是上帝让世界存在的意义
And he will think that is why God made the world.

758
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,930
仅此而已
Just that.

759
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,390
{\an8}第一幕

760
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,160
{\an8}第一幕
我包罗万象

761
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,940
查克一直盼着能有个小妹妹
Chuck was looking forward to having a baby sister.

762
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,950
更盼着父母能赶紧回来
Of course, he was also looking forward to having parents,

763
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:37,070
谁料95号高架上结的冰让一切化为泡影
but none of that worked out thanks to a patch 95 of well-hidden ice on an I-95 overpass.

764
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,130
事发时查克没在车上
Chuck wasn't in the car when it happened

765
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,920
他父母去享受二人世界
because his parents were having a dinner date

766
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,360
那天晚上他爷爷奶奶带他
and he was being babysat by his grandparents,

767
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,270
他那会儿还叫他们阿爷阿奶
who, at the time, he was still calling Zaydee and Bubbie.

768
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,860
{\an9}Zaydee和Bubbie是东欧犹太移民常用的祖父母称呼

769
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,840
他那时七岁了
He was seven years old.

770
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,920
真赞喔
Excellent job.

771
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:01,070
一年半载 屋子里全是悲伤
For a year and a half, it was a house of unadulterated sadness.

772
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:05,990
对阿尔比和莎拉·克兰兹来说 不只是儿子和儿媳没了
Albie and Sarah Krantz had not only lost their son and daughter-in-law...

773
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,470
咋不吃饭了？
Why're you not eating?

774
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,070
那本该三个月后出生的孙女也没了
...they had lost the granddaughter who would've been born just three months later.

775
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,770
咋回事儿？
What's going on?

776
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,080
名字都选好了...
The name had already been picked out...

777
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,520
-她叫艾雨莎 -艾雨莎
-Her name is Alyssa. -...Alyssa.

778
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,060
查克说那名字听着像下雨时
When Chuck said that sounded to him like rain,

779
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,130
他妈哭笑不得
his mother had laughed and cried at the same time.

780
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,430
他永远忘不了那表情
He never forgot that.

781
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:34,800
阿尔比靠两件事来排解悲伤
Albie processed his grief by turning to his two absolutes,

782
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,190
算账和喝酒
numbers and alcohol.

783
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,110
但对莎拉来说 一切却都失去了滋味
Sarah, though, could find no joy in her usual pleasures.

784
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:47,980
曾让她陶醉的音乐 艺术和美食
She loved the flavors of life, music, art, and food,

785
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,500
如今都索然无味
but now, found the world quiet and gray and flavorless.

786
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,860
随着时间流逝 家里又慢慢有了些温暖
Some of the good feelings came back into the house with time.

787
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,480
事故后全靠外卖度日
There were a lot of takeout meals after the accident,

788
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,740
但查克快十岁那年 他奶奶又重新下厨
but around the time Chuck turned 10, his grandma started cooking again.

789
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,590
她做饭时爱放摇滚乐
She liked rock-and-roll while she was cooking.

790
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:20,600
查克肯定觉得太潮了 可她显然乐在其中
Music Chuck would've thought much too young for her, but which she clearly enjoyed.

791
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:42,440
来吧 小老弟 来跳舞吧
Come on, little brother, let's dance.

792
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,790
{\an8}《西区故事》

793
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,110
{\an8}《雨中曲》

794
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,730
{\an8}《歌厅》

795
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,980
{\an8}《爵士春秋》

796
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,230
{\an8}《封面女郎》

797
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:37,510
{\an8}电影《封面女郎》(1944)

798
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:42,380
小宝 你有本事学会 你天生是跳舞的料
You could learn those moves, kiddo. You're a natural.

799
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,790
你在哪学的？
Wh-Where did you learn?

800
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,640
高中
High school.

801
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,320
你上高中的时候是什么样的？
What were you like in high school?

802
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,670
我可是个小辣妹
I was a kusit.

803
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,665
{\an9}Kusit为希伯来语

804
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,210
千万别把我这话告诉你阿爷哦
But don't you tell your Zaydee I said that.

805
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,090
他是个老古董
He's old school, that one.

806
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,320
查克守口如瓶
Chuck never told.

807
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,870
他把爷爷奶奶家处处都当自己家
His grandparents' house became every inch his home

808
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:11,370
除了塔尖阁楼
with one exception. the cupola on the roof.

809
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,930
查克被严令禁止进那阁楼
Chuck was forbidden to go into the cupola.

810
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:23,360
那是他爷爷的一条铁律 不容置疑
That was his grandfather's rule, and it was absolute, emphatic.

811
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,750
他爷爷阿尔比做事宽容
Albie wasn't a stern man in other matters.

812
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:30,060
平时人挺温和的
He was downright gentle in most respects.

813
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,540
偏偏在这事上绝不讲情面
But on this point, he was rigid.

814
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,230
查克可不止问过一次
Chuck asked about it, of course, and more than once.

815
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,240
那上头有什么？从高高的窗户能看到啥？
What was up there? What could you see from the high window?

816
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:48,310
最重要的是 为啥老是锁着？
And the big question, why was the room locked?

817
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,370
他奶奶说...
Grandma said...

818
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,880
楼上地板不结实 一踩就会坍下去
Because the floor isn't safe and you might go right through it.

819
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:52,820
他爷爷说...
Grandpa said...

820
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,080
由于那烂地板 屋子里空无一物
There's nothing up there because of that rotten floor.

821
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,960
你往窗外瞅 也就只能看到商场
And the only thing you can see through the windows is the shopping center.

822
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:05,390
他一直这么说 直到查克十一岁生日前一晚
He said that until, one night, just before Chuck's 11th birthday,

823
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,170
他才吐出部分实情
when he told at least part of the truth.

824
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,790
{\an7}宇宙历年法
The cosmic calendar

825
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:14,540
{\an7}把宇宙的历史压缩到一本365天日历
compresses the local history of the universe into a single year.

826
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,100
{\an7}从1月1日宇宙诞生算起
If the universe began on January 1st,

827
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,900
{\an7}我们的银河系要到5月才出现
it was not until May that the Milky Way formed.

828
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,720
俗话说酒后吐真言
Drinking is not good for secrets.

829
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:28,160
当儿子 儿媳还有那个名字听着像下雨的
And after the death of his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter-to-be,

830
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,880
未来孙女艾雨莎全都去世后
Alyssa, who sounds like rain,

831
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,210
阿尔比·克兰兹就拼命喝酒
Albie Krantz drank a great deal.

832
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:37,430
{\an7}人类全部的历史
Everything humans have ever done occurred in that bright speck

833
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:41,590
{\an7}都在这本日历的最后一天
at the lower right of the cosmic calendar.

834
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:46,960
我打赌 从阁楼往外看 能看到西福商场
I'll bet you could see way past the Westford Mall from the cupola.

835
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,360
整座小镇肯定也能看得一清二楚
You gotta be able to see the whole town from up there, I bet.

836
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:58,710
要真上去了 你看见的可不只是风景
If you went up there, you might see a lot more than you wanted.

837
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,110
小查 这门紧锁是有原因的
That's why it's locked, Chucko.

838
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:04,370
{\an7}日历里每个月代表12.5亿年
Every month is one and a quarter billion years long.

839
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,910
{\an7}每一天代表4000万年
Each day represents 40 million years.

840
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,210
他想问清楚
He wanted to ask what Grandpa meant.

841
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,160
尽管他才10岁
But the adult part of him, not there in person, no, not at 10,

842
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:19,070
可脑子里的成熟声音冒出来
but something that had begun to speak on rare occasions,

843
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:26,860
告诉他别吭声 安静地等着
told him to be quiet. Be quiet and wait.

844
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:31,220
{\an7}人类的全部历史就像我手掌那么大
But all of human history would occupy an area the size of my hand.

845
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:36,290
{\an7}现在让我们回到太古时代...
We're just beginning to trace the long and tortuous path which began with the primeval...

846
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,490
你知道这房子是什么风格的吗？
You know what style of house this is?

847
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,010
维多利亚风格
Victorian.

848
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,790
没错
That's right.

849
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:49,370
可不是仿古的 1885年建的正经维多利亚式
And not pretend Victorian either. It was built in 1885.

850
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,420
后来翻新过大概六次吧
It's been remodeled half a dozen times since.

851
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,340
可那阁楼一直保留至今
But that cupola was there from the start.

852
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,860
我七十年代初搬来
Been here since '71.

853
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,310
搬来至今 我上那阁楼都没到六次
And in all those years, I haven't been up to that damn cupola half a dozen times.

854
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,950
因为地板烂了？
'Cause the floor is rotted?

855
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,820
因为闹鬼
'Cause it's full of ghosts.

856
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,490
{\an7}...发生在12月31日的晚上10点30分
...around 10:30 p.m. on December 31st.

857
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,270
-还记得圣诞述异那个故事吗？ -嗯
-Y-You remember Scrooge? -Yeah.

858
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,950
那部叫做《圣诞欢歌》的电影？
That Scrooge movie we watched?

859
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,270
记得
I remember.

860
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,930
你觉得那算鬼故事吗？
Do you think of that as a ghost story?

861
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,630
算吧
I-I-I guess so.

862
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:30,340
有人说那是鬼故事
Heard someone say it was a ghost story.

863
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:37,000
他吓的说“圣诞节未卜先知”
Christmas Yet to Come.

864
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:39,620
{\an7}晚上11点59分20秒...
11:59:20，evening, last day of the...

865
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,860
杰弗里家那男孩一个月后就没了
Jefferies boy was a month later.

866
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:54,740
亨利·彼得森拖得久些 等了四五年
Henry Peterson, that took longer. Four...maybe five years on.

867
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:02,520
到那时 阁楼里看到的 我几乎忘得精光
And by then...I almost forgot what I saw up there.

868
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,400
几乎
Almost.

869
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,630
我说过再也不上去
Said I'd never go back up there after that.

870
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:18,120
真不想上去 要不是为了莎拉
And I wish I hadn't because of Sarah.

871
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,510
为了你的阿奶 小查
Because of your Bubbie, Chucky.

872
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:27,430
最疼你的阿奶
Your sweet Bubbie.

873
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,340
都是面包
And the bread.

874
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,940
{\an7}我们听说过的所有人...
Every person we've ever heard of, somewhere in there...

875
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,880
这就是等待 小查
It's the waiting, Chucko.

876
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,110
这是最难熬的
That's the hard part.

877
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:50,160
{\an7}所有历史书上的事 都只发生在这本日历最后10秒钟里
Everything in the history books happened here in the last 10 seconds of the cosmic calendar.

878
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:52,510
呜 外面真冷
Ooh! It's getting cold out there.

879
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,160
维拉向大家问好 还谢我煲的汤
Vera says hi. She says thanks for the soup.

880
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,280
她把八卦全抖给我 抖得可带劲了
She laid the gossip on me, laid it good.

881
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,350
当然 要不然咱咋离不开她呢
Of course...That's why we have a Vera, isn't it?

882
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,380
有什么新鲜事吗？
So, what's the latest?

883
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,730
知道吗 凯伦和马蒂在搞婚姻咨询
Well, I don't know if you've heard, but Trish is saying Karen and Matty are in therapy.

884
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:15,970
-搞什么？ -阿爷 亨利·彼得森到底是谁？
-Again. -Who's Henry Peterson, Zaydee?

885
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:18,000
{\an7}...珍惜我们的宇宙 不要辜负这150亿年
...the universe that made us or we can squander our 15 billion-year heritage.

886
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,080
再买点煎饼粉
And get some pancake mix.

887
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,770
要黄盒的 别买橙盒的 都记住了吗？
Yellow box, not the orange box. You got all that?

888
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,180
记住了
I got it.

889
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,960
-要我写下来吗？ -我记得住
-Do you need me to write it down? -I got it.

890
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,300
别开车 走路去能醒醒酒
Don't you think about driving. The walk will sober you up.

891
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,780
好 好 好
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,470
他去便利店了 一会儿就回来
He'll be back with some groceries.

893
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:58,340
要不今晚一起烤棉花糖？
Then, how about tonight, we do some s'mores in the fireplace?

894
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,570
随便
Yeah.

895
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,010
好吧
Yeah.

896
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:06,050
他是不是跟你说闹鬼的事了？
Was he blabbing to you about his ghosts?

897
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,550
阁楼里闹鬼的事？
The ones that live in the cupola?

898
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,490
是呀
Yeah.

899
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,700
是真的吗？
Well, are there?

900
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,400
你说呢？
What do you think?

901
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,060
别太信你阿爷
I wouldn't pay too much attention to Zaydee.

902
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:26,600
他人不错 就是有时喝得太多
He's a good man. But, sometimes, well, sometimes, he drinks too much.

903
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,770
喝多了就会天马行空 你懂他那一套
Then he rides his hobby horses. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

904
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,730
杰弗里家男孩是谁？
Who was the Jefferies boy?

905
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,110
好吧 小宝 那是件让人心酸的事
Well...that was a very sad thing, kiddo.

906
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,780
他住旁边那巷子
He lived on the next block over,

907
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,310
追球追到马路上结果被车撞了
and he got hit by a car when he chased a ball into the street.

908
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:52,810
那是很久前的事儿了
It happened a long time ago.

909
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:00,800
要是你爷爷说他提前见过那一幕 他并没有
And if your grandpa says he saw it before it happened, he's mistaken.

910
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:06,800
那只是他酒后乱说
He just drinks too much.

911
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:20,290
要不我帮你送到史坦利奶奶那儿？
You know, I could take those to Mrs. Stanley if you want.

912
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,900
哎呀 你真贴心 维拉看到你肯定特开心
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you. I bet Vera'd love that.

913
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,480
简直绝了
Just wonderful.

914
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,510
你奶奶真是个烘焙大师
Your, your grandmother is an artist.

915
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,310
谢谢你带来 你主动要来送的吧？
Thank you for bringing them over. Was that your idea?

916
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,050
-说实话哦 -是的
-Be honest. -It was.

917
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,700
要喝茶吗？
Well, can I make you a cup of tea?

918
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,390
其实我不喝茶 有杯牛奶就完美了
Um, I don't drink tea, but, um, I wouldn't mind a glass of milk.

919
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:46,100
你奶奶真是个大好人
Well, your grandmother's a saint.

920
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,470
你爷爷呢？
And what about your granddad?

921
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,650
他背上那东西去检查了吗？
Did he have that thing on his back looked at?

922
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,150
嗯 医生拿掉了 还做了化验
Yeah, the, the doctor took it off and had it tested.

923
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,850
全告诉我
Tell me everything.

924
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,550
不是坏的那种
It wasn't one of the bad ones.

925
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,290
谢天谢地
Thank God for that.

926
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,780
嗯
Yeah.

927
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:07,600
他跟奶奶聊那个叫亨利·彼得森的人
He, um, he was talking to Grandma about someone named Henry Peterson.

928
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,910
太惨了
So awful.

929
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,350
亨利跟你爷爷一样是管账的
You know, Henry was a bookkeeper, just like your granddad.

930
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,750
还接了镇上你阿爷扛不下的活儿...
He did a lot of the other businesses in town. The ones that your Zaydee didn't do...

931
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,170
到底怎么回事？
How did it happen?

932
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,750
这种事你还是别听了
I don't think you want to hear about that stuff.

933
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:26,550
呃 爷爷说 说那很平和
Um, w-w-well, Granddad said it was, uh, peaceful.

934
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,270
平和？
Peaceful?

935
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,190
他自尽了 上吊的
He killed himself. Hung himself.

936
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,890
他老婆跟个刚满十八的小伙子私奔了
His wife, you see, she ran off with this younger man, barely old enough to vote.

937
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:38,460
她自己都四十多了 你怎么看？
And she was in her 40s. What do you think of that?

938
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,030
-天哪 -对 可不是
-Wow. -Damn right, wow.

939
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,880
我还听说...
And then, I heard that...

940
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,180
学校那边有什么新鲜事？
What's happening at school?

941
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,470
谁和谁在亲亲啦？
Who's smooching who?

942
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:58,780
放心说吧 无人能闻得见 我只多留片刻
"Talk honestly, for no one else hears you and I stay only a minute longer."

943
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,790
我是否自相矛盾？
"Do I contradict myself?

944
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:06,570
好吧 那我就自相矛盾
"Very well then, I contradict myself,"

945
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:11,010
我心疆无限 我包罗万象
"I am large. I contain multitudes."

946
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,320
六年级的最后一堂课上
On the last day of sixth grade,

947
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:19,540
那位小清新气息 管不住课堂的理查兹老师
Miss Richards, a sweet, hippie-dippyish young woman who had no command of discipline

948
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,420
怕是很快就要被劝退
and would probably not last long in the public education system,

949
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:32,770
还是在查克班上照念惠特曼《自我之歌》的诗
tried to recite for Chuck's class some verse of Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself."

950
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,260
若最初寻我不得 莫失信心
"Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged.

951
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,440
错过此处 再觅它方
Missing me one place, search another."

952
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:55,140
这节课还算顺利 对吧？
That went well, don't you think?

953
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,830
嗯 让您为难了
Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry about that.

954
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:09,380
惠特曼那句“我心疆无限 我包罗万象”是啥意思？
What does he mean when he says, "I am large, I contain multitudes"?

955
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,730
你觉得他想表达什么？
What do you think he means?

956
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,090
包罗他认识的所有人
All the people he knows.

957
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:15,520
对
Yes.

958
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,050
但也许不止于此
But maybe he means even more.

959
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,870
来 过来
Here. Come here.

960
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,780
我的两手之间 那里有什么？
What's in there? Between my hands?

961
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,570
我头
My brain.

962
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,790
不 不是这个意思
No, um, that's not exactly what I mean.

963
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:37,010
我是说 在我两手之间 里面装的是什么
What's in there? Right between my hands right now.

964
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:38,180
我不知道
I don't know.

965
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,260
里面有你认识的所有人吗？
All the people you know?

966
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,800
有吧
I guess.

967
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,780
就只有你认识的人吗？
Just the people you know?

968
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,460
里面是你见过的记住的一切
Everything you see. Everything you know.

969
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,570
是整个世界 查克
The world, Chuck.

970
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:56,290
天上的飞机 地上的井盖
Planes in the sky. Manhole covers in the street.

971
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,430
年复一年 你脑海中的世界
Every year that you live, that world inside your head

972
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:04,130
会越来越大 越鲜明 越丰富 越复杂
will get bigger and brighter and more detailed and complex.

973
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:07,780
你会在脑海中构建城市 国家 大陆
You will build cities and countries and continents,

974
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,650
并用真实和想象的人去充实那里
and you will fill them with people and faces, real and imagined.

975
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,070
明白了吗？
Do you understand?

976
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,790
别就此止步
Don't stop there.

977
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:21,240
把你见过的 认识的
You fill the whole thing with everyone you ever meet,

978
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:26,750
甚至想象的每个人都给装进去
everyone you ever know, everyone you ever just imagine.

979
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,760
它就变成了个小宇宙
It'll be a universe.

980
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:35,330
整个宇宙就在我两手之间
A whole universe right between my hands.

981
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:40,850
你能包罗万象
You contain multitudes.

982
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,960
那...
So...

983
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:48,260
那个宇宙会怎样 要是有人...
what happens to that universe if someone...

984
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,440
比如说
I don't know,

985
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:56,790
在冰面上打滑 冲下高架桥 或者...
hits a patch of ice and goes off an overpass or...

986
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,790
别太纠结这些
Don't worry too much about those things.

987
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:05,320
只要记住 你包罗万象 查克
Just remember that you contain multitudes, Chuck.

988
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,770
这多棒啊
Isn't that wonderful?

989
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,450
好了 就这样 你真是个好孩子
Now, go on. You were such a good boy.

990
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:15,410
能教你我很开心
I've really enjoyed having you in class.

991
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:39,440
查克暑假本来过得挺好 直到八月
Chuck did enjoy his summer until August,

992
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:42,690
他阿奶去世了
when Bubbie died.

993
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,400
事情发生在街角的便利店里
It happened at the grocery store down the street,

994
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:52,150
公开场合 有点不太体面
in public, which was a little undignified,

995
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:56,250
至少这种死法能让人安心地说...
but at least it was the kind of death where people can safely say...

996
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,070
幸好她一生没受什么罪
Thank God she didn't suffer.

997
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,560
至于那句...
The other standby...

998
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,390
她一生又长又圆满
She had a long, full life.

999
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:05,160
就说不准了
...was more of a gray area.

1000
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:09,620
毕竟她才六十多岁
Sarah Krantz had yet to reach her mid-60s.

1001
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:18,720
又一次 家里再次陷入彻底的悲伤
Once more, the house on Pilchard Street was one of unadulterated sadness.

1002
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:22,800
阿尔比戴上了黑纱 越发消瘦
Albie wore his mourning band, and lost weight,

1003
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,220
也不再讲笑话了
and stopped telling his jokes

1004
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,930
比他实际七十岁还显老
and began to look older than his 70 years.

1005
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:39,370
-就买这点？ -嗯
-That's it? -Yeah.

1006
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,980
一块七毛五
Buck 75.

1007
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:50,340
几周前来的那个女士 就是后来去世的那位
Um, that lady who was in here a few weeks ago, the one who died.

1008
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,780
事情发生在哪儿？
Where was she when it happened?

1009
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,380
小朋友 这话题有点吓人
That's a little creepy, kid.

1010
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,430
她是我奶奶
She was my grandma.

1011
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,060
她当时想拿面包
She was getting a loaf of bread.

1012
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,620
结果把整排货架都拽倒砸她身上了
Pulled down almost everything on the shelf when she collapsed.

1013
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,250
要是我说多了 你别介意
I'm sorry if that's too much information.

1014
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:14,630
没事
Nah.

1015
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:18,720
我早知道了
I already knew that.

1016
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,160
-别！ -啥？
-No! -What?!

1017
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:20,830
-走开 快走开 -等下
-Get away from there! You get away from there. -What? Hey, hey!

1018
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:45,070
把锁给我
Give me that.

1019
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,930
给我 给我
Give it to me. Give it to me.

1020
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:51,520
抓紧给我
Give me it.

1021
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:57,420
哦 对不起
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

1022
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

1023
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,870
你没受伤吧
Are you okay?

1024
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:03,730
你看到了什么？
What did you see?

1025
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,650
到底看到了什么？
What did you see?

1026
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,610
对不起 你不能去那里
I'm sorry. It's just, you can't.

1027
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,570
绝不能去那里 小查
You can't do that, Chucky.

1028
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:15,260
绝不能
You just can't.

1029
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,100
哦 我真对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1030
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:23,070
哦 对不起 真的 真是对不起
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I'm sorry.

1031
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:36,790

Come on, little brother. Let's dance.

1034
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,660
舞侠们 舞者们 大家好
Hello, twirlers, and hello, spinners.

1035
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:11,750
哎呦 今年居然有三个男孩 破纪录了
What do you know? Three boys this year. It's a new record.

1036
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,150
小先生们别怕被取笑
You gentlemen might find yourselves being teased for your new hobby.

1037
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:19,020
我保证 你们是全校最聪明的
I assure you, you are the smartest young men in the whole school.

1038
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,070
待会儿你们就明白了
You'll soon see what I mean.

1039
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,110
不认识我的同学们 我是罗巴赫老师
For those who don't know me, I am Miss Rohrbacher.

1040
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:28,770
在女子体育课外 我被尊称为...
And when I'm not teaching the girls phys-ed,  I am what a few students have called,

1041
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,470
舞林怪才
"The Dance Monster."

1042
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,300
没反应？好吧
Nothing? Alright.

1043
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,170
你们加入的社团堪称学校最牛的
You have chosen what might be the best club this school has ever had.

1044
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,310
与女排社团并驾齐驱
'Cause if we didn't have girls volleyball, we wouldn't have nothing.

1045
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,350
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1046
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:47,350
回来 马尔福同学 你现在归我管了
Back, Mr. Mulford, you are mine now.

1047
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,670
华尔兹
Waltz.

1048
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,340
查克会跳
Chuck knew it.

1049
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:58,730
恰恰舞
Cha-cha.

1050
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,440
查克也会跳
Chuck knew it.

1051
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,810
摇摆舞
Swing.

1052
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,590
三拍步 摇摆步
Triple step. Rock step.

1053
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:09,080
查克还会跳
Chuck knew it.

1054
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,750
三拍步 摇摆步
Triple step. Rock step.

1055

桑巴舞
Samba.

1056
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,130
没跳过这个
Don't know that one.

1057
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,390
他是这小社团里跳的最好的
He was, by far, the best dancer in the little club.

1058
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:24,960
老师常让他和不会跳的女生搭档
So, Miss Rohrbacher mostly put him with the girls who were clumsy.

1059
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:30,180
他明白老师的用意 也乐意帮忙
He understood she did it to make them better, and he was a good sport about it.

1060
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,750
快下课前
Near the end of their two hours, however,

1061
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:38,100
舞林怪才才心软 让他和凯特·麦考伊搭档
The Dance Monster would show mercy and pair him with Cat McCoy,

1062
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:43,890
她八年级 也是所有女生里跳得最溜的
who was an eighth grader and the best dancer of the girls.

1063
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,630
查克可没动她的心思
Chuck didn't expect romance.

1064
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:51,640
卡特确实漂亮 不过也比他高一头
Cat was not only gorgeous, she was a full foot taller than he was.

1065
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:56,770
但他很喜欢和她一起跳 她也有同感
But he loved to dance with her, and the feeling was mutual.

1066
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,430
...外 二 三 转
...three. Out, two, three. Switch.

1067
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,250
好 停
And stop.

1068
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:03,870
内 二 三 外 二 三
In, two, three. Out, two, three.

1069
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,600
转 换箱步
Turn. Now box.

1070
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:11,920
一 二 三 一 二 三
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1071
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,270
看 你 们 跳 的 啥
I don't know what that is.

1072
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:15,880
老 天 呐
Oh, my God.

1073
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:20,610
算了 自由练十分钟
Okay, 10 minutes freestyle.

1074
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,780
嘿 瞧好
Hey. Watch this.

1075
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,080
快教我
Show me how you did that.

1076
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,560
看好
Ready?

1077
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,520
滑 滑 滑
Slide, slide, slide.

1078
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,650
来试试
Here, ready?

1079
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,130
来跟我学
Try it with me.

1080
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,960
不行 把鞋脱了 穿袜子滑
Uh, kick off your shoes and do it in your socks.

1081
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,640
好 好
Aye-aye.

1082
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,280
滑右脚
Now, slide.

1083
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,270
滑左脚
Slide.

1084
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,620
看 你学会了
Yeah. There you go.

1085
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:14,670
来 让我看看
Hey! Show me.

1086
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,160
停 滑 停 滑 滑 滑
Pop. Slide. Pop. Slide. Slide. Slide.

1087
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,550
再来次
Yeah, again.

1088
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,890
停 滑 停
Pop. Slide. Pop.

1089
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,130
那天下课晚了半小时
Twirlers and Spinners let out half an hour late that day.

1090
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,260
刚太酷了 你自己琢磨出来的吗？
That's so rad. You figured that out by yourself?

1091
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:41,970
我就不断回放 反复看 最终学会的
Well, I just kept rewinding and rewinding 'til I figured it out.

1092
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,940
在舞会那天我们一起跳这个吧
We should do that at the Fling.

1093
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:50,230
呃 别误会 才不是要跟你谈恋爱
Uh, not as a date or anything.

1094
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,890
我跟道奇·温特沃斯在一起
I'm going out with Dougie Wentworth.

1095
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,480
你知道吧？
You know that, right?

1096
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,360
知道
Yeah.

1097
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:02,380
可这不妨碍我们露露绝活
But that doesn't mean we couldn't show them some cool moves.

1098
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,350
我超想跳 你呢？
I really want to. Do you?

1099
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,990
我 我不确定
I-I don't know.

1100
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,840
我太矮了
I'm a lot shorter.

1101
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,540
人们会笑话我的
I think people will laugh.

1102
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,600
-这管用 -确实管用
-That totally works. -It totally does.

1103
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,850
-确定吗？ -当然确定
-Are you sure? -Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

1104
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,890
感觉很好
Well, they feel great!

1105
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,810
就是码有点大
Uh, just a little big.

1106
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,240
差不多了
That should be enough.

1107
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,050
-再塞点 -再塞点
-Little more. -Maybe one more.

1108
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,790
怎么样？
How's that?

1109
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:49,430
就像溜冰一样
Floor feels like ice.

1110
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:52,840
要是把地板刮花 可要被揍
You put scratches on that floor, the janitor is gonna beat y...

1111
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:58,040
蒂米 不会刮花的 他很轻的
Timmy. There won't be no scratches. He's too light on his feet to leave any.

1112
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:01,920
几乎都对了
Almost perfect.

1113
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:08,510
这两题再算一遍
Take another run at these two.

1114
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,230
别叹气 你有这方面天赋 知道吗？
You don't need to sigh. You're good at this, you know?

1115
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,880
你真的很出色
You're really good at it.

1116
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,450
好吧 可这也太枯燥了
Yeah, but it's boring.

1117
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:19,230
枯燥？是说数学吗？
Boring? What, you mean math?

1118
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,410
嗯
Yeah.

1119
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:25,100
我觉得你下学期课后应该报个数学竞赛社
I wonder if maybe next semester you might want to try Math League after school.

1120
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:29,040
我整个高中都在参加 特有趣
I did it all high school, in fact, and it was so great.

1121
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:32,070
我现在报的是舞蹈社团
I'm doing Twirlers and Spinners.

1122
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,820
对
Yeah.

1123
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:38,630
嘿 先放下笔 先听我说说
Hey, hey, put that down for a second, will you?

1124
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,090
说点数学的事
Just a little about math.

1125
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,390
人们最初都以为它很枯燥
Because people start out thinking it might be boring,

1126
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,960
这就是错在起点
and that's their first mistake.

1127
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,410
无论干什么职业 做哪份工作
It's used in every career, in every job,

1128
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,480
地球上生活的方方面面都离不开它
in every facet of life on this planet.

1129
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,700
毋庸置疑 就连地球自己也离不开它
That's a fact. Hell, the planet.

1130
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,800
一天到底有多长？
How do you think we figure out how long a day is?

1131
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,340
谁都知道一天有多长
Everybody knows how long a day is.

1132
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,930
-多长？ -24小时
-How long? -Twenty-four hours.

1133
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:08,410
大家都说一天有24小时 但这是错的
People say it's 24 hours, but they're wrong.

1134
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:13,900
在恒星日中一天有23小时零56分钟
There are 23 hours and 56 minutes in a stellar day.

1135
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,510
还零几秒钟 数学可以证明
Plus a few odd seconds. Math proves it.

1136
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,950
怎么知道地球存在多久？
How do we know how old the Earth is?

1137
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:23,250
宇宙存在多久？人类又存在多久？
How old the universe is, how long people have been here?

1138
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:28,000
又怎么建桥 盖楼 测星距
Or how to build a bridge or a skyscraper or how far apart the stars are?

1139
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,830
怎么登月的？
How did we land on the moon?

1140
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,680
星星是怎么燃烧的？原子怎么聚变裂变的？
The stars themselves. Why they burn, why atoms split and fuse,

1141
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,840
这些都离不开数学
and all the rest is just math.

1142
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,580
星星本身就是数学产物
Hey, stars are just math.

1143
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,540
当你仰望夜空时
When you look at the night sky,

1144
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,630
看到的是宇宙最壮丽的方程式
you're seeing the greatest equation in the universe.

1145
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,460
更别说你的舞蹈 那也是数学
Heck, your dancing, that's math too.

1146
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,460
舞蹈的语言到底是什么？
I mean, what's the language of dance?

1147
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,450
你怎么学舞步的？
How do you learn your steps?

1148
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,040
名字就在那里 叫数拍
 It's even in the name. I mean, they call it "the count."

1149
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:59,680
一 二 三 四
One and two and three and four.

1150
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,510
华尔兹呢？一 二 三 一 二 三
What's a waltz? One, two, three, one, two, three.

1151
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,690
全是数字 都是数学
Just numbers, just math.

1152
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,800
不仅如此
And more than that,

1153
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:10,610
数学可以是门艺术
there's an art to it.

1154
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:15,570
我干的活儿 你看这堆文件 这些档案
What I do, all these files here, all these folders,

1155
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:18,320
记录的都是人们的生活
these are all people's lives.

1156
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:20,970
他们每个选择
Every choice they made.

1157
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,390
去年 过去十年
Last year, last 10 years.

1158
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,540
他们在意的一切
Everything that's important to them.

1159
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,710
所有缺点 嗜好和梦想
Every weakness they have, every vice, every dream,

1160
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:32,670
全都体现在数字里
it's all here in numbers.

1161
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:35,150
要是哪个外行进来 生搬硬算
Some schmuck comes in, takes those numbers,

1162
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:39,160
缺了艺术感 就能害人丢了房子
does the math without artistry, someone loses their house.

1163
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:43,160
而我注入一丝艺术匠心
I take those numbers, do a little art,

1164
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,600
便能救人于难
I save someone's life.

1165
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,250
这就是会计的魅力
That's what I do.

1166
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:51,050
这就是会计的意义
That's what accounting is.

1167
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,110
也许他们该教这些有趣的
Well, maybe they should teach that, the cool stuff,

1168
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,300
别教枯燥的
and not just all the boring stuff.

1169
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,460
嗯
Hmm.

1170
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,710
数学可不止这些
Math is something else too.

1171
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:14,540
像统计学 概率学
Some math, math that's called statistics or probability,

1172
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,030
可以未卜先知
it can tell you stuff about your future.

1173
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:21,560
比方说
It could tell you, for example,

1174
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:25,630
你进职业球队的几率
you're more likely to be drafted by a major league sports team

1175
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:29,610
大过靠跳舞谋生
than to make a real living as a dancer.

1176
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,780
大家都爱看跳舞 没错
The world loves dancers, it truly does.

1177
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,700
可社会更需要会计师
But it needs accountants,

1178
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,840
需求大所以机会也多
so there's much more demand, so there's much more opportunity.

1179
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:48,050
我知道这话扎心 但这就是事实
I know that might hurt, but it's the truth.

1180
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:53,060
数学只讲事实 它不会撒谎
Math is truth. It won't lie to you.

1181
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,810
数学不掺感情 它就是这么纯粹
It doesn't factor in your preferences. It's pure that way.

1182
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,560
数学能做很多事
Math can do a lot of things.

1183
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,380
数学可以是门艺术
Math can be art.

1184
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,860
但数学可不会撒谎
But it can't lie.

1185
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,880
所以...
So...

1186
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:15,560
再把那两题重算一遍吧
take another run at those two because, Chucko,

1187
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,520
小查 你很出色
you are good.

1188
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,990
你有 艺术细胞
You... have art in you.

1189
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,170
嘿！你今天超好看的！
Hey! You look great!

1190
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:09,260
谢谢 你也是
Thanks. Uh, you too.

1191
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:12,310
想不想给他们露两手？
Wanna show 'em how it's done?

1192
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:19,020
这个 我不 我 我可能扭到脚了
Uh, I don't know. I kinda, um...I kinda hurt my leg.

1193
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,090
真的假的？
You hurt your leg?

1194
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:24,660
要不 要不 等首更好的歌吧？
Maybe, maybe let's, let's wait for a better song.

1195
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,780
嘿 小子
Hey, kiddo.

1196
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,850
嘿
Hey.

1197
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:55,180
我以为你今晚要大放异彩呢
Thought you were gonna tear it up tonight.

1198
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,360
我 我也不知道
I don't, I don't know.

1199
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,520
鞋子怪怪的
My shoes feel all funny,

1200
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:03,470
我 我脚扭了
and... I hurt my leg.

1201
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,670
哦 你脚扭了？
Oh, you hurt your leg?

1202
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,020
嗯
Yeah.

1203
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:11,230
真替你可惜
I'm sorry to hear that.

1204
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,980
你一个人来的？
So, you came stag, huh?

1205
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,570
-啥？-没带约会对象？
-Hmm? -No date.

1206
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,290
没 我
Nah, I...

1207
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:22,950
情况会变的 相信我 迟早会变 再等等
That'll change. Believe me, it'll change. Just give it some time.

1208
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,770
舞池里这些...
None of this, none of...

1209
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,650
舞池里这些都不重要
None of that out there really means anything.

1210
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:33,440
跳得怎样 都只是热身和演习 别把它当真
It's all just, just a scrimmage. Just a practice.

1211
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,830
嘿 这首正好 来跳吧
Hey, this is perfect. Come on.

1212
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,180
不行 我...
Nah, I'm still, uh...

1213
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,750
我脚还怪怪的
My leg's still wonky.

1214
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:43,660
查克 得了吧 让我们炸翻全场
Chuck, come on. We're gonna blow the roof off.

1215
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,370
对不起
I'm sorry.

1216
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,270
真的很痛
It really hurts.

1217
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:07,690
我从八岁就开始跳舞 又教体育
You know, I've been dancing since I was eight, and I teach PE,

1218
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,120
看过不少孩子受伤后的样子
and I've seen when my kids get hurt.

1219
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,630
他们走路都不一样了
I see how their walk changes.

1220
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,570
站姿也怪
I see how their posture changes.

1221
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,720
说句实话 在我看来
And don't mind me saying, but you look...

1222
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,400
查克 你看上去好好的
Well, you look fine to me, Chuck.

1223
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,060
我没逼你非得跟她跳 决定权在你
I'm not saying that you have to dance with the girl. It's up to you.

1224
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:31,200
我只想说 不管跳不跳 别说谎
 I'm just saying dance or no dance, you don't have to lie.

1225
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,650
跟她实话实说
Tell her the truth.

1226
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:38,700
她会理解的
She can take it.

1227
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:54,720
-准备好了吗？ -嗯 来跳吧
-You ready? -Yeah. Let's do it.

1228
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:20,520
再跳一遍！再跳一遍！
One more time! One more time!

1229
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:28,420
他们年纪虽小 却足够聪明知道何时收场
They may have been young, but they were smart enough to know when to quit.

1230
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:35,390
谢谢大家
Thank you, guys.

1231
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:40,700
在他39岁因脑瘤早逝前六个月
Six months before he died of a brain tumor at the unfair age of 39,

1232
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,440
趁头脑还算清楚
and while his mind was still working, mostly,

1233
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:50,750
他跟妻子珍妮坦白了手背上疤的来历
Chuck told his wife the truth about the scar on the back of his hand.

1234
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:52,620
最开始交往时
When they'd first started dating,

1235
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,250
他说这疤是那晚舞会后
he told her he'd gotten it from a boy named Doug Wentworth,

1236
01:34:56,270 --> 01:35:01,150
舞伴凯特的男友温特沃斯因为吃醋
who was pissed about him dancing with his girlfriend at a middle school formal

1237
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:04,530
把他推到围栏上铁丝划的
and pushed him into a chain link fence outside the gym.

1238
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,710
这疤我没说真话
I lied about that, though.

1239
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:14,680
哇 你还是这么神秘
Oh, my. A man of secrets, even still.

1240
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,870
亲爱的 怎么弄的？
What happened, love?

1241
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:20,560
那晚舞跳完
When our fabulous dance was over, I...

1242
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,740
我全身又汗又热
I was sweaty and I was so hot.

1243
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,920
脸都热得通红
I-I felt like my cheeks were gonna catch fire.

1244
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,190
跳的太好了
You were great.

1245
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,870
-谢谢 -真是个大明星啊
-Thank you. -What a star.

1246
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,490
我那时只想逃离灯光
All I wanted in that moment was just darkness,

1247
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:39,950
 吹吹凉风 一个人呆会儿
cool air, and to be by myself.

1248
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,720
那晚天空繁星闪烁
There were millions of stars that night.

1249
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,590
千万星辰
Millions of them.

1250
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:50,330
千层万叠
And millions more behind them.

1251
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:55,290
也许 嗯 它们只是天文数字
And sure, m-may... Yeah, maybe they were just math.

1252
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,920
却好像在翩翩起舞
But they also danced.

1253
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,380
我知道 因为那一瞬我看见了
I know 'cause I saw one of them.

1254
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,520
我那时想 宇宙广阔无限
And I remember thinking, the universe is large

1255
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,060
宇宙包罗万象
and, and it contains multitudes,

1256
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:13,460
也包含了我
but it-it also contains me.

1257
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:19,670
而在那一刻 我真觉得自己很精彩
And in this moment...I am wonderful.

1258
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:22,920
我理应拥有这份精彩
And I have a right to be wonderful.

1259
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,870
啊
Oh!

1260
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,160
干嘛为这事撒谎 小傻瓜
Why lie about that, silly?

1261
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:35,070
你真是个奇妙的存在 亲爱的
You're a strange wonder, my dear.

1262
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:41,990
他没再多说 因为那道疤另有深意
He doesn't offer more because the scar was important for another reason.

1263
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:45,170
是他讲不完的故事的一环
It was part of a story he couldn't tell,

1264
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:50,180
其中有他长大的那幢维多利亚老宅
even though there was now an apartment building on the site of the Victorian house

1265
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,740
尽管早拆了盖楼了
where he had done most of his growing up.

1266
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,960
那幢闹鬼的维多利亚老宅
The haunted Victorian house.

1267
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,860
不知道
No reason.

1268
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:03,100
就是心血来潮吧
Funny thinking, I guess.

1269
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,630
这疤意义非凡 他也尽力讲得加料
The scar meant more, so he had made it more.

1270
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:12,070
可讲得总没有它真正的意义深
He just couldn't make it as much more as it really was.

1271
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:14,290
讲得还有点糊涂
That made little sense.

1272
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:18,690
但随着脑癌细胞的疯狂进攻
But as the glioblastoma continued its blitzkrieg,

1273
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:24,910
他那快散架的大脑最多也只能讲到这样
it was the best his disintegrating mind could manage.

1274
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:58,640
查克的爷爷 他的阿爷
Chuck's grandpa, his Zaydee,

1275
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:04,470
在那场秋季舞会五年后 因心脏病发作去世
died of a heart attack five years after the Fall Fling dance.

1276
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:06,920
事发时查克读高二
Chuck was a junior in high school

1277
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:08,730
是乐队主唱
singing in a band and

1278
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,980
正在台上像摇滚巨星一样跳得带劲儿
dancing like Jagger during the instrumental breaks.

1279
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,220
他自己都安排妥当了
He made all the arrangements himself.

1280
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,120
几周前
Came in a few weeks ago

1281
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:20,730
还特地来馆里再确认一遍
just to make sure everything was to the letter,

1282
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:23,010
我还纳闷呢
which I thought was strange.

1283
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,390
很少有人这么上心
Not many people bother to do that.

1284
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:30,010
大多数人只来一趟定好流程
Most people, they come here once to set it all up.

1285
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,410
办好手续就不再来了
They aren't anxious to come back again.

1286
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:40,070
再见到那人 都是穿着体面衣服躺那儿 懂吧
Next time I see 'em, they're in their Sunday best, if you get me.

1287
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:44,180
他人特好 也是我多年的好友
He was a great man and a good friend.

1288
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,750
他为我们做账整整二十三年了
He's been doing our books for 23 years

1289
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:53,040
账做得稳 多次税务检查都帮我们顺利过关
and saved our skin more than once when the tax man was coming.

1290
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:56,340
要现在给你结账吗？
So, do I owe you any money?

1291
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,940
一分都不用
Not a penny.

1292
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:03,700
他那次来就把钱全给结清了
He took care of that too. Settled his tab that same visit.

1293
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,500
听我说
You know...

1294
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,050
最离奇的是
the strangest thing.

1295
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,400
这事儿很怪 可别觉得我扯
And this will sound strange, so bear with me.

1296
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:13,050
说来话长
See,

1297
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:18,110
年轻时我曾想当电视上天气预报员
I, uh, dreamed of being a television weatherman in my salad days

1298
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:20,850
也许能成全国台的
with maybe one of the networks.

1299
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,980
最终没成
Wasn't in the cards for me.

1300
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:28,120
倒是去地方台待过一个夏天
But I did spend a summer at WKNB.

1301
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,950
在那儿 有个同事号称能
Well, there was a guy at KNB who they said

1302
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:38,930
不用雷达就能提前两周感知风暴
could feel a storm coming two solid weeks away without the radar.

1303
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,690
有第六感
Had a sixth sense.

1304
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,040
简直了
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

1305
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,350
他会露出一种神情
Uh, used to make this face,

1306
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:48,830
当别人说要出远门
this face when people talked about their travel plans,

1307
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,920
然后他洞察出什么后
if he knew something they didn't.

1308
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:55,930
那神情不笑不乐
Not... not a smile, per se. No joy in it.

1309
01:39:55,950 --> 01:40:00,370
就一脸 我全知道的样子
Just a... knowing.

1310
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:03,310
我管那叫 预报员天眼
"Weatherman Stare," I called it.

1311
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:06,010
我可没那本事
And I didn't have it, not me.

1312
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,890
所以我在这行 而不是那行
So, I'm here, not there.

1313
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:16,600
你爷爷来时也带着同样的神情
Your granddad had that same face when he was in here.

1314
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:20,730
像是 他早料到要下雨
Like... he knew it was gonna rain.

1315
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,480
而我只是个卖他伞的人
And I was just a guy selling him an umbrella.

1316
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,770
那就是预报员天眼
Weatherman Stare.

1317
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,370
我敢打包票
I'm sure of it.

1318
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:33,110
太离谱了
The strangest thing.

1319
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,450
爷爷阿尔比把一切家当都留给了他
Albie left him everything.

1320
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:40,090
这足够支付他的大学学费
More than enough to pay for his college education.

1321
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:43,450
再后来 他把那幢维多利亚老宅卖了
And later on, the sale of the Victorian

1322
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,430
用这笔钱买了
paid for the house he and Ginny moved into

1323
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:50,460
和他妻子珍妮度蜜月后住的新家
after their honeymoon in the Catskills.

1324
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:56,250
他铁了心不去奥马哈和外公外婆一起住
He flatly refused to move to Omaha to live with his mother's parents.

1325
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:58,160
-听着 我真的很爱你们... -他这样说
-Look, I love you guys... -He said.

1326
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:01,630
...但我在这里长大的 也想在这待到上大学
...but this is where I grew up and want to stay till college.

1327
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,690
我都17了 不是小孩子了
I'm 17. I'm not a baby.

1328
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:09,650
于是 早已退休的老两口 住进那幢维多利亚老宅
So, they, both long retired, came to him and stayed in the Victorian

1329
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,520
陪查克二十多个月
for the 20-odd months before Chuck went off

1330
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:16,840
直到他去伊利诺伊大学
to the University of Illinois.

1331
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,600
可他们没赶上参加葬礼
They weren't able to be there for the funeral, however.

1332
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:24,280
葬礼办得很快 正如阿尔比所愿
It happened fast, as Albie had wanted,

1333
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,260
他外公外婆在奥马哈还有一些事要收尾
and his mom's folks had loose ends to tie up in Omaha.

1334
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:32,890
说实话 查克并不怎么想他们
Chuck didn't really miss them, if he was honest.

1335
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:40,750
他跟他阿爷一样 最讨厌瞎折腾 也受不了人多
His Zaydee hated a fuss almost as much as he hated a crowd.

1336
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,470
他们来的前一天
A day before they were scheduled to arrive,

1337
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:46,840
查克才拆开
Chuck finally opened the envelope

1338
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:51,120
放玄关桌上的那大信封
that had been sitting on the table in the front hall.

1339
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,870
信封是来自山姆·亚伯勒
It was from Sam Yarborough,

1340
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:57,960
亚伯勒殡仪馆的老板兼首席殡葬师
owner and chief undertaker at Yarborough Funeral Home,

1341
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:04,700
里面装着阿尔比·克兰兹的个人物品
and inside were Albie Krantz's personal effects.

1342
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,170
在这屋里 查克爷爷见过杰弗里家那男孩
In this room, Chuck's grandpa had seen the Jefferies boy,

1343
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:06,840
被车撞得血肉模糊
body broken by the car.

1344
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:11,230
他见过亨利·彼得森吊在天花板上
He'd seen Henry Peterson hanging from the ceiling.

1345
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:14,510
他还见过他妻子躺在地上断了气
He'd seen his own wife lying dead.

1346
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:16,930
查克想
And likely, Chuck supposed,

1347
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:20,970
也许就在那晚他偷钥匙的时候
perhaps the night Chuck had stolen his keys,

1348
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:25,330
阿尔比还看见自己摔倒在地
Albie had even seen himself crumpled to the floor,

1349
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:28,770
死死抓着胳膊
still clutching his upper arm.

1350
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:32,550
“这就是等待”他说
"It's the waiting," he'd said.

1351
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:35,640
“这是最难熬的”
"That's the hard part."

1352
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:39,950
现在轮到查克自己的煎熬了
Now Chuck's own waiting would begin.

1353
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:42,910
他到底要等多久？
How long would that wait be?

1354
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:48,860
病床上那个人到底多少岁？
Exactly how old was the man in the hospital bed?

1355
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:57,180
看不见的监护仪发出最后一声“哔”
There was a final bip from the unseen monitor

1356
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,600
然后也随之消失
and then that was gone too.

1357
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:07,630
他不像电影里那样慢慢淡去
The man did not fade, as ghostly apparitions did in the movies.

1358
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:10,280
就直接不见了
He was just gone.

1359
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:15,080
仿佛他从未出现过
Insisting he had never been there in the first place.

1360
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,930
-那不可能... -查克想
-He wasn't... -Chuck thinks.

1361
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,860
...我偏不信
...and I will insist he wasn't.

1362
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,520
我会痛痛快快地活 直到最后一刻
And I will live my life until my life runs out.

1363
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:29,280
我很精彩
I am wonderful.

1364
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:33,380
我配得上这份精彩
I deserve to be wonderful.

1365
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:37,620
我包罗万象
And I contain multitudes.

1366
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:05,680
