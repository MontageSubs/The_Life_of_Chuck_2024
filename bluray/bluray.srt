过去与现在都已凋零
"The past and present wilt.

20
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,660
我充盈它们 又将它们掏空

然后继续去充盈未来的下一折页

云端的倾听者啊！有何秘密要向我倾诉？
"Listener up there! What have you to confide to me?

23
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,670
当我细嗅暮色时 直视我的面庞
"Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening.

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,760
放心说吧 无人能闻得见 我只多留片刻
"Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer."

25
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,240
我是否自相矛盾？
"Do I contradict myself?

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,770
好吧 那我就自相矛盾
"Very well then, I contradict myself.

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,600
我心疆无限 我包罗万象

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
怎么了？
What is it?

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,890
什么事让你打断惠特曼的诗？
Clearly something more interesting than Whitman.

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,590
是加州 那又地震了
California. There was another earthquake.

-就那样没了 -别慌 别慌

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,230
没网了
Got no connection.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,250
你们有网吗？
Anybody else have one?

40
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,140
没有
No.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,500
抱歉 网还用不了
Oh, eh, sorry. Network's still down.

42
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,870
{\an8}无网络连接

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,920
不过 这有纸质文件
I've got his file here, though.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,960
迪伦最近在摸鱼
Uh, Dylan's been diving lately.

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,860
这学期他成绩从A和B跌到了D
I mean, this semester, he's gone from As and Bs to Ds.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,260
你有纸质备份？
You keep hard copies?

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,580
当网时好时坏时就开始保存了
When the network started acting up, a lot of us started keeping hard copies.

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,630
你觉得这次网还能恢复吗？
What do you think? I mean, you think it's coming back?

49
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,560
我不知道
Well, I don't, I don't know.

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,500
我还记得互联网诞生前的世界
I remember the world before the internet.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,980
没网的惨状不难想象
Why is it so hard to imagine carrying on without it?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
对吧？
It is, though, isn't it?

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,720
还能恢复网吗？还有戏吗？
How do we go back? How... Can we go back?

54
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,510
如果这次彻底没戏了怎么活？
What if it's down for good this time?

55
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,790
还没网
Internet's still down.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,230
是没网 但别担心
Yeah, but lucky for us,

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,310
我有所有学生的纸质文件
I've got hard copies for each student.

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,250
我有预感
I think this might be it.

59
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,610
我感觉这次网不会恢复了
I don't think it's coming back this time.

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,020
你八成是对的
You might be right.

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,820
但重点是艾米丽 她开始旷课了
But I do think we should talk about Emily.  Her attendance has really fallen off.

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,370
她旷课了？
Her attendance?

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,870
全球旷工旷课都破天荒了
Absenteeism's at an all-time high all over the world.

64
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,870
医生旷 飞行员旷 警察也旷
We got doctors and pilots and cops

65
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,140
大家都他妈擅离职守
and everyone's just pissing the fuck off, right?

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,920
但你却只想着艾米丽？
But you, you want to talk to us about Emily?

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,010
现在还怎么上课？
How are they supposed to study, anyway?

68
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,140
网络崩溃已经八个月了
Web's been on the fritz for eight months.

69
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,040
有一半网站都是乱码
Half those sites are just garbled.

70
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,930
我懂 网坏了
I mean, I get it, sites go dark.

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,780
但其他问题呢？
But what about all that other stuff?

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,420
有些网站还好
Like, sites are there,

73
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,580
但都是错字和错误标点
but all the punctuation's wrong. words spelled wrong.

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,030
你能解释吗？
How do you explain that?

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,420
我不能
Well, I can't,

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,490
但布莱恩还能来上课
but Brian can still prepare for class.

77
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,560
即便没网 课本都还在啊
I mean, the library's still here. Internet or not.

78
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,540
色情网站没了
Pornhub's down.

79
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,600
安德森老师 你知道吗？
Did you know that, Mr. Anderson?

80
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,440
呃 是啊
Yeah, I, uh,

81
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,590
我 我 我听说了 是的
I, I, I had noticed that. Yeah.

82
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,700
对不起 小布给你添麻烦了
Sorry if Bri's been any trouble.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,860
这家就我一人了
It's just me now.

84
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,320
他妈妈跑了 我不知道去哪了
His mom... she left, I don't know where.

85
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,970
听说最近这事常见
That's been happening a lot more I hear,

86
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,710
人们只是玩失踪
people just ghosting.

87
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,500
她高中那会儿认识个无缘的男友
Hers was some star-crossed boyfriend from high school.

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,100
待在一起有一个月吧
They dated a month.

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,140
那该死的一个月
Goddamn month.

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,030
就为了那一个月 她竟然丢下二十年的感情
She's gonna throw 20 years in the trash to chase down a month.

91
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,990
我猜她一直藕断丝连他
I guess she never stopped thinking about him.

92
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,860
谁心里没有放不下的人
I guess we've all got someone like that.

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,410
我懂 我懂
I mean, I get it,

94
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,670
就像那些穿紫袍说的那样 要真是末日了
if it really is the end, like those kooks in the purple robes say,

95
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,910
最终和谁一起面对呢？
then who do you want to be with for it?

96
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,900
她要抛弃骨肉吗？
But to leave her son?

97
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
对了 她说会回来的
Uh, she says she'll be back.

98
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,330
我也不确定
I don't know. Um...

99
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,860
该死的色情网站
Fuckin' Pornhub.

100
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,760
万一永远不回来了呢？
What if that never comes back?

101
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,040
真他妈的倒霉
Fuckin' tragedy.

102
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,110
就算这真是一切的结局
I mean, even if it is the end of all things...

103
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,140
这也提前把我结束了
that's just fuckin' mean.

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,460
-见笑了 -嗯
-Sorry. -Yeah.

马蒂·安德森第一次看到那广告牌那天
The day Marty Anderson first saw the billboard

122

恰巧就在互联网彻底瘫痪前
was just before the internet finally went down for good.

123
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,190
在那之前网时好时坏有八个月了
It had been wobbling for eight months,

124
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,690
但占据头条的是其他事件
but other problems, like fires, earthquakes,

125
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,480
像是大火 地震 鸟和鱼的彻底灭绝

We'll be back to talk more about this

139
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,520
{\an9}稍后将带来中西部大火和缺水的最新情况
and, uh, also about the fires in the Midwest, speaking of water scarcity, back after this break.

140
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,780
{\an9}感谢查尔斯·查克·克兰兹39年来的峥嵘岁月
We'd like to say thank you to Charles Krantz for 39 great years.

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
{\an9}谢谢你 查克
Thanks, Chuck.

142
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,020
嘿
Hey.

143
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,440
听说你又救了一个？
Heard you got another one.

144
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,080
嗯 又一个
Yeah. One more.

145
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,270
我的没那么幸运 手腕都割烂了 你懂的
Mine wasn't so lucky. Slit wrists, so...

146
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,250
真没办法了
what were we supposed to do really?

147
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,950
听说玛丽露的事了吗？
Hear about Marilou?

148
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,690
没 怎么了？
No. What about Marilou?

149
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,910
她不干了
She left!

150
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,630
-还记得她前任佩德罗吗？ -记得
-Her ex. Remember Pedro? -Mm-hm.

151
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,610
他冒出来 嘟囔了几句
He showed up, and I don't know what he said to her,

152
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,200
两人牵着手就走了
but she walked out holding his hand.

153
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,940
他们离婚离的有多难熬
And I remember how bad that divorce was.

154
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,660
-有印象吗？ -嗯 记得
-Do you remember? -Yeah, I remember.

155
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,360
好吧 往事如烟了 他们又拉上了手
Well, I guess that's all bridge water 'cause off she went.

156
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,800
{\an9}...地陷不断出现
...sinkholes that have been opening up.

157
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,340
现在婚姻都咋样？
I wonder what the stats are.

158
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,740
是分居多还是复合多？
You think more people are splitting up or getting back together?

159
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
是结婚多还是离婚多？
I mean, do you think marriage rates are up or divorce rates...

160
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,770
结婚多
Marriages.

161
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,000
-你是个乐天派 -不
-You're an optimist. -No.

162
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,700
离婚周期长 没人会去排这个队
Divorce takes way longer, and I don't think anyone's filing.

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,920
填文件就得半年多 何苦呢？
Why bother? Six months of paperwork at least. Probably more.

164
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,430
结婚领证上下只要一小时
Marriage license is one page and it takes an hour or so.

165
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,230
所以我猜结婚多
I'm gonna guess marriages.

166
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,220
{\an7}午餐不见你 晚餐也不在
Missed you for lunch, missed you for dinner.

167
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,690
{\an9}【电影《封面女郎》(1944)】

168
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,870
{\an7}怎么了？辟谷了吗？
What's the matter? Don't you eat anymore?

169
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,610
{\an7}好吧 我不饿
Well, I wasn't hungry tonight.

170
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,180
{\an7}那你今早也不饿吗？
Weren't you hungry this morning either?

171
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,490
{\an7}谁拿了我的舞蹈袜？天哪 谁那么坏
Who stole my nylons? Egads! The very...

菲莉西娅·戈登来电

173
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,180
{\an7}不饿
 Not very.

174
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,500
{\an7}昨晚排练到很晚吗？
Too much rehearsal last night, huh?

175
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,940
{\an7}就像锻炼一样
It was kind of a workout.

176
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,730
{\an7}赖床了？所以今早来的那么晚
That why you slept late?

177
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
{\an7}我可没晚起
Oh, I didn't sleep late.

178
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,990
{\an7}我去了上城区
I went uptown.

179
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,300
{\an7}-去购物？ -不是
-Shopping? -No.

180
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,710
喂
Hey.

181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,870
喂
Hi.

182
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,770
你给挂了？
You hung up?

183
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,200
是啊
Yeah.

184
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,400
但后来想你看的到 所以又...
But then I figured you probably saw it. So...

185
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,030
还好吗？
How are you?

186
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,600
还行
I'm okay, I guess.

187
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,780
你呢？
How are you?

188
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,650
我上班时想到你了
I was, um, thinking about you today.

189
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,460
当时在猜结婚多还是离婚多
We were at work talking about marriages and divorces. Like, which are happening more now...

190
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
我赌结婚多
Marriages, I bet.

191
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,840
没人愿意等离婚
Ain't nobody waiting on a divorce.

192
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,470
那么再婚呢？
What about remarriages?

193
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,420
要约炮得先请我喝酒
You want to buy a guy a drink first or...

194
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,770
我打赌人们都在复合
I bet those are happening.

195
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,630
这很有意义
I mean, it makes sense.

196
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,150
人们现在渴望慰藉和熟悉的事物
People wanting something comforting and familiar.

197
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,760
那么 你今天过得怎么样？
So... how was your day?

198
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,740
你想复合的意图太明显了 不觉得吗？
You're just going right for it, aren't you?

199
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,020
陪我聊聊
Humor me.

200
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,990
呃 今天就那样
It was, um...It was a day, I guess.

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,690
有点怪
You know? Weird.

202
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,350
家长会开的就像对牛弹琴
Parent-teacher sessions, felt like pissing in the wind.

203
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,020
你听说加州的事儿了吧？
You know about California, right?

204
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,790
听说了
Yeah.

205
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,460
我听说大部分人都迁移了
I know they're saying most of it was already evacuated,

206
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,940
今天就有几十万灾民东迁
but I heard today there are hundreds of thousands of refugees trekking east.

207
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,730
知道现在内华达州是全美人口最多的州吗？
Did you know Nevada is one of the most  populous states in the Union now?

208
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,710
听国家电台科学家说 加州就跟烂墙皮一样往下掉
I heard a, a scientist on NPR say California is peeling away like old wallpaper.

209
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,900
今天下午 日本又有一座核电站被淹
And another Japanese reactor got inundated this afternoon.

210
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,220
他们虽说 停机了 一切安全
And they're saying, you know, it was shut down and all's well,

211
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,190
但我就是没法相信
but I just, I, I don't think I believe that.

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,410
你真是个怀疑论者
Cynic.

213
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,330
好吧 马蒂 这日子就是这么不靠谱
Well, we're living in cynical times, Marty.

214
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,010
不少人都认为天要塌了
I mean, some people think we're living in the last times.

215
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,180
不再是邪教成员这样想了
Not just the religious crazies either. Not anymore.

216
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,280
市立医院自杀小队的许多专家也这样说
And you are hearing that from a member in good standing of the City General Suicide Squad.

217
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,580
那是我们的自称
That's what we call ourselves now.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,180
可没瞎说
No lie.

219
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,890
今天有6人没挺过来 但救回了18人 主要用纳洛酮
We lost six today, but there's 18 more we dragged back, mostly with naloxone.

220
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,910
{\an9}【纳洛酮用于抢救吞药自尽】

221
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,500
但这种药已经供不上了
But supplies of that are getting very thin.

222
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,400
我听药房说最多坚持到月底
And I heard the head pharmacist say we might be completely out by the end of the month.

223
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,340
太倒霉了
That sucks.

224
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,100
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

225
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,030
是的 太倒霉了 真的太倒霉了
Yeah, that sucks. It, it really sucks.

226
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,480
互联网瘫痪 加州下沉
The internet's down, and California's hanging by a thread.

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,650
还有大火 饥荒 疫情和各种灾难
There's fires and famines and plagues and all the rest.

228
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,490
连我们医院也快崩溃了
I mean, it just the center doesn't hold.

229
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,380
有完没完
It just won't let up.

230
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,020
那天还有多久？
How long is this gonna go on?

231
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,410
那之前还能撑多久？
How much can we take before the whole thing...

232
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,660
我是说 天塌下来前
before the whole thing goes apart, I mean.

233
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,530
我在教孩子们卡尔·萨根的理论
I'm teaching the kids Carl Sagan right now.

234
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,530
{\an9}【卡尔·萨根是知名的美国天文学家】

235
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,480
你听说过他的宇宙历年法吗？
You ever hear what he said about the cosmic calendar?

236
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,080
呃 想不起来 应该没听过
Uh... I don't know. I don't think so.

237
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,340
你知道 宇宙已有150亿年历史
Well, the universe is 15 billion years old.

238
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
如果你把这150亿年
And if you took all of that all, all 15 billion years

239
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,400
都给它压缩到365天的日历中
and compress them into a single calendar year,

240
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,250
那么宇宙大爆炸发生在1月1日第一秒
then the Big Bang happens in the first second, January 1st.

241
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,040
{\an8}一月份

242
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,575
而如今
And, and today,

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,820
我们正处于12月31日 最后一天的最后一刻
oh, right now, we're in the final millisecond of the last minute of the last day, December 31st.

244

{\an8}十二月份

245
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,760
回到起点
But if you go back to the start,

246
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,110
回到大爆炸发生的1月1日夜里
if the, if the Big Bang happens at midnight, January 1st,

247
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,200
日历里每个月等于12.5亿年
then each month of this calendar is one and a quarter billion years long.

248
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,480
嘿 别考我数学
Hey, nobody told me there was math on this exam.

249
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,210
宇宙在1月1日诞生
The universe starts January 1st,

250
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,900
但此时我们的银河系还没形成 形成要到5月
but the, uh, the Milky Way didn't form until May.

251
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,540
{\an8}五月份

252
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,440
我们的太阳和地球 要到9月中旬才形成
Our sun and our earth, they don't show up until mid-September.

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,010
{\an8}九月份

254
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,440
生命不久后就有了 但没轮到我们
Life appears soon after. But not us.

255
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,570
猜猜我们什么时候出现的？
No. No, no, we don't appear for guess how long?

256
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,790
再说一遍 今天不考数学
Again, I was told there'd be no math.

257
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,080
在12月31日
December 31st.

258
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,690
出现在日历上的最后一天
Last day on the calendar,

259
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:22,750
{\an8}十二月份

260
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:29,310
最早的人类出现在晚上10点半左右
and the very first human beings on Earth made their debut around 10:30 p.m.

261
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,810
出现在最后一天的晚上10点半
10:30 p.m. on the last day.

262
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,200
每一分钟代表着3万年
And, um, every minute since then is 30,000 years.

263
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:46,860
晚上11:46 距离午夜14分钟 人类才学会用火
So, 11:46 p.m., only 14 minutes ago, humanity tamed fire

264
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,790
在距离午夜只剩几秒钟时
and now we're out of minutes, we're into seconds.

265
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,830
到11点59分20秒
11:59 and 20 seconds,

266
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:00,920
动植物才被驯化 人类刚开始能制造工具
the domestication of plants and animals begin, an application for the human talent for making tools.

267
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,270
到11点59分35秒
11:59 and 35 seconds,

268
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,060
农耕社区演变为首批城市雏形
agricultural communities evolved into the first cities.

269
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,020
我们记载的所有历史
Our recorded history,

270
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,760
听说过的所有人
everyone we've ever heard of,

271
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:24,450
所有历史书上的事 都只发生在最后10秒钟里
every single thing in any one of our history books happens in the last 10 seconds.

272
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:32,410
所有事都集中在最后一天最后一分钟的最后十秒
The last 10 seconds of the last minute of the last day on the calendar.

273
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,620
日历的最后一天
December 31st.

274
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,530
该怎么回答你那天还有多久？
So how long is it gonna go on?

275
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,700
我不知道 小菲
I don't know, Fel.

276
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,140
要是你说得对 很可能真是这样
If you're right, and you might be,

277
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,020
这可能就是末世 宇宙正在消亡
that this really is the, the last times and the universe is dying,

278
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,670
就算它在快速消亡
and let's just say it's a fast death,

279
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,020
即使这一切都发生在最后一秒
even if all of this is happening in the, the last split second,

280
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,980
最后一微秒
microsecond,

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
谁知道对我们来说是多久
who knows how long that'll last.

282
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,420
也许是几秒钟 也可以是无限长
Maybe seconds, maybe eons.

283
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,860
也许发生在宇宙吐出最后一口气的时候
Maybe all this is happening as the cosmos burps out its last breath.

284
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,550
也许发生在宇宙最后一次心跳的时候
Maybe it's all happening in the last single solitary heartbeat.

285
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,940
你真能说 马蒂
Jesus, Marty.

286
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,610
是吧
Yeah.

287
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,790
好了 小菲 我该挂了 我...
Listen, Fel, I should go. I've, um...

288
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,120
还得批改试卷呢
I've got tests to grade.

289
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,340
马蒂
Marty...

290
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,640
一切都完了 我们也只剩下句真倒霉
the world is going down the drain, and all we can say is, "That sucks."

291
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,580
说不定谁都躲不掉这劫
So, maybe we're going down the drain too.

292
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,250
说不定
Maybe.

293
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,730
听说了吗 查克·克兰兹要退休了
But, you know, Chuck Krantz is retiring.

294
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,130
都要天塌下来了 还有这个插曲
So...I guess there's a gleam of light in the darkness.

295
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,760
听说了 39个峥嵘岁月
Yes. Thirty-nine great years.

296
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,440
哦 你也看到那个奇葩的广告牌了？
Oh, you saw that weird billboard?

297
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,440
不 是从收音机里听到的广告
No, it was an ad on the radio that, um,

298
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,350
之前跟你讲的那个国家电台
that NPR show I was telling you about.

299
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,680
国资电台都开始打广告了 这真是世界末日了
If they're running ads on NPR, it really is the end of the world.

300
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,620
在这个乱世他还怎么算广告覆盖率
Tell me, how does Chuck Krantz rate this kind of coverage?

301
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,150
我是说 他像个会计师
I mean... looks like an accountant.

302
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,250
我从没听说过他
I've never heard of him.

303
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,200
广告一定用了张老照片
Used an old photo too, I guess.

304
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,420
他看着都不到40 咋来的40年工龄
I mean, the guy barely looks 40 at all, let alone 40 years on the job.

305
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,600
无奇不有
The world is full of mysteries.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,030
嘿 马蒂 别喝烈酒了
And, hey, no hard stuff, Marty.

307
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,470
喝点啤酒吧
Okay? Have a beer instead.

308
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,630
遵命
You got it.

309
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,370
俄州环保局对克利夫兰一带下达了空气红色警报
The Ohio EPA has now issued a code red air quality alert for Cleveland and its surrounding...

310
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,360
{\an8}俄州山火蔓延 克利夫兰居民紧急疏散
（滚动新闻：余震后加州海岸线不断下沉）

311
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,520
{\an9}【电影《封面女郎》(1944)】

313
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,160

{\an8}信号中断

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,580
我勒个去
Shit on a stick.

316
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:26,240
感谢查尔斯·查克·克兰兹39年来的峥嵘岁月
We'd like to say thank you to Charles Krantz for 39 great years.

317
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,100
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹

318
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,800
谢谢你 查克
Thanks, Chuck.

319
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:35,450
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

320
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,650
{\an8}信号中断

321
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
格斯
Gus!

322
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,660
哦 嘿 马蒂
Oh. Hey, Marty.

323
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,970
怎么不开车了？
Where's your car?

324
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,300
车 车停在半山腰了 好几百辆车都扔路上了
It's... it's on, it's on the sidewalk halfway down Main Street Hill with a hundred others.

325
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,870
我只好步行
I finally just had to turn around.

326
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,690
该死 我走了
Fuck it, I walked...

327
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,220
猜我走了多远？ 这有五公里了吧？
What do you think it is, like, three miles?

328
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,180
我走了将近五公里
I just walked three miles.

329
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,390
哦 你是这要去学校吧 等下
Oh, you're going to school. Hold on a sec.

330
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,220
呃 我想下 你得绕 你得绕
Uh, real quick, you gotta, you gotta go,

331
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,230
你得绕道走11号公路
listen to me, you gotta go out Route 11

332
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,580
然后在转到19号公路
and then hook back on, on, on 19.

333
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,840
是呀 路上会很堵
Yeah. There's gonna be plenty of traffic.

334
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,320
你大概得绕至少30公里
You gotta go out at least 20 miles.

335
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,800
运气好中午能到
You might make it before lunch.

336
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,240
-别指望早到 -发生了什么事？
-I wouldn't count on it. -What happened?

337
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,460
市场街和主街交叉那有大地坑
Giant sinkhole opened up on Market and Main.

338
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,550
老兄 陷得太大了
Man, the-the thing, it, uh, it's huge.

339
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,810
要么是降雨导致的
All the rain probably had something to do with it,

340
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,590
要么是缺乏维护
lack of maintenance maybe more so.

341
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,900
至少轮不到我去修
But it's not my department, thank God.

342
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,950
但是 坑下面得有二十多辆车吧
But, yeah, there's, there's gotta be 20 cars at the bottom.

343
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,340
那些车里的人 永远上不来了
And some of the people in some of those cars, they ain't comin' back.

344
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,210
老天 我昨天下班就堵在那里
Jesus, I was, I was just there last night,

345
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,740
堵在那好久
backed up in traffic.

346
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,520
幸好你今早不在那里
Thank God you weren't there this morning.

347
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,130
听说加州的事了吧
I assume you know about California.

348
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,830
我今早没看电视
I didn't turn on the TV this morning.

349
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,050
-难怪 -有什么新闻吗？
-Oh! -Is there something new?

350
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,010
都沉下去了
The, the rest of it went.

351
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,530
电视说北加州20%还尚存
I-I mean, th-they're saying that 20% of Northern California is hanging in there,

352
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,320
实际也许还剩10%
which probably means, what, 10%?

353
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,240
但是粮食产区都没了
But the food-producing regions are... they're gone.

354
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,190
中西部被烧成个焦土
And with the Midwest turning to charcoal

355
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,890
佛州又被水淹
and Florida flooding, that's like

356
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,370
全国粮仓都没了
all the food-producing regions in the country just gone.

357
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,770
欧洲的情况也差不多
And the same thing with Europe.

358
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,330
亚洲也在闹饥荒
I mean, it's famine time in Asia.

359
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,770
听说那死了一百万人
There's a million people dead.

360
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,370
他们管它叫做 树 树疫
They're saying it's the bub-bublonic,

361
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,600
-树疫病 -鼠疫
-bubonic plague. -Bubonic.

362
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,560
对 鼠疫
Bu-Bubonic plague. Yeah.

363
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,860
还有蜜蜂 十多年前就不正常
And the bees, I mean, they were in trouble a decade ago,

364
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,340
但现在所有蜜蜂都没了
but they're completely gone now.

365
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,040
也许南美洲还有几个蜂巢吧
I mean, there's a couple of hives or whatever down in South America,

366
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,960
但不产蜂蜜
but there ain't no honey, honey.

367
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,740
没有这些小虫虫 怎么给剩下的庄稼授粉呢
And without those little guys, like, what's gonna pollinate all the crops we have left?

368
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,790
要我说 我可...
I mean, I can't do...

369
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,140
先打住 稍后聊
Excuse me. One sec.

370
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,440
哦 哦 好
Yeah, yeah. That's-that's cool.

371
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,310
是 安 安德莉娅吗？
A-Andrea? Are you,

372
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,190
你是中西部信托银行的安德莉娅吗？
are you Andrea from Midwest Trust?

373
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,230
我是菲莉西娅·安德森的丈夫
I'm Felicia Anderson's husband.

374
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,410
实际上 是前夫
Ex, actually.

375
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,930
我觉得你和小菲互相认识
I think you and Fel know each other.

376
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,720
我们之前在大卫家聚会时见过
We met at a, a, a game night at David's.

377
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,830
几晚游戏聚会
A few game nights.

378
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,200
对 记得
Yeah, sure.

379
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,810
你想干什么？
What do you want?

380
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,070
车堵在路上 我刚走了半天
I just had a long walk, and my car is stuck,

381
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,420
而银行 斜了
and the bank is, it's leaning.

382
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,830
斜了？
Leaning?

383
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,240
是的
Yeah.

384
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,240
银行就在地坑旁边
It's on the edge of the sinkhole.

385
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,990
估计我的职业生涯到此为止
Guess that's the end of my job.

386
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,170
嘿 你们银行上头那广告牌是啥意思
Hey, I'm curious about the billboard on the bank building.

387
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,480
-你看到了吗？ -怎么能躲得过？
-Have you seen it? -How could I miss it?

388
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,860
那广告还出现在电视上
And I saw the ads too, on TV.

389
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,210
电视不再播卖车卖家具的广告了
No more ads for cars or discount furniture.

390
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,610
只播“感谢查尔斯·克兰兹39年来的峥嵘岁月 谢谢你 查克”
Just, "Charles Krantz, 39 great years. Thanks, Chuck."

391
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,530
他不是你银行的人？
So, he doesn't work at the bank?

392
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,400
他不是从你银行退休？
He's not retiring from the bank?

393
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,100
我根本不认识这个人
I don't know Charles Krantz.

394
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,930
我觉得这就是个恶搞 玩行为艺术
I think it's just a prank. Performance art.

395
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,510
你保重
Take care.

396
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,510
他们看起来像是灾民
They look like refugees.

397
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,710
是啊
Yeah.

398
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,390
至少大家不再惊慌失措了
No one looks that concerned.

399
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,170
那又怎样？
What good would that do?

400
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,690
刚开始大家都惊慌失措
All was concerned at the start.

401
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,520
还记得那些抗议吗？
Remember the protests?

402
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,390
还记得他们推倒白宫的围栏吗？
You remember they knocked over the fence at the White House,

403
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,310
记得他们向那些学生开枪吗？
and all those students got shot?

404
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,050
-是的 -还有俄罗斯政府被推翻
-Yeah. -And the overthrow of the Russian government.

405
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,660
巴基斯坦和印度间的四日战争
You got the Four Day War between Pakistan and India

406
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,970
还有他妈的德国火山喷发
and the fucking... the volcano in Germany.

407
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,440
德国火山还能喷发 太扯了
There was a volcano in Germany. That's, that's crazy.

408
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,980
我们自我安慰 一切都会过去的
And we just kept saying, "Oh, it's gonna blow over."

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,690
看来过不去的 对吧？
That doesn't look to be happening, though, does it?

410
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,460
是啊
No.

411
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,330
我觉得自杀的人最终会减少
I think that suicides will slow down.

412
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,950
我觉得人们最终会等待
I think people will just...wait.

413
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,080
等什么？
For what?

414
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,150
等结局
The end.

415
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,020
万物的大结局
This is the end of everything.

416
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,110
我们正处在悲伤模型第五阶段
I mean, we're, we're going through the five stages of grief.

417
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,750
{\an9}【库伯勒-罗丝悲伤模型五阶段：否认 愤怒 恳求 沮丧 接受】

418
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,460
你明白吗？我们到了最后阶段
Don't you get it? I mean, we just, we just landed on the final stage.

419
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,500
接受
Acceptance.

420
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,380
等待 才是最难熬的
The waiting...I think that's the hardest part.

421
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,630
灾难不打声招呼就冒出来了
And the whole thing, it just, it-it came out of nowhere, right?

422
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,290
我是说 大家早知道有自然环境问题
I mean, everyone knew there was trouble with the environment.

423
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,810
即便是右翼疯子也私下里心知肚明
I mean, I think even the right-wing nutjobs were secretly, they got it.

424
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,390
但现在
But this...

425
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,330
现在这些
this...

426
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:30,430
现在这些不过是各种屁事的集合
this is just 60 different varieties of shit.

427
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,910
屁事排山倒海地来
It's just so much shit that happened fast.

428
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,180
现在一年都十四个月了
It's like a year, man. Fourteen months.

429
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,040
倒霉啊
Sucks.

430
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,520
是啊 倒霉啊
Yeah. Sucks.

431
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,630
飞机写字
Skywriting.

432
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,190
长大后就再也没见过这种事
I haven't seen one of those since I was a kid.

433
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,810
{\an8}谢谢你 亠亠

434
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,080
搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

435
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,570
我也想问同样的问题
My sentiments... exactly.

436
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,710
{\an8}谢谢你 查克

437
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,180
{\an8}谢谢你 查克！

438
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,830
{\an8}街头艺人万岁

439
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,060
{\an8}查克万岁

440
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,690
{\an8}查克我爱你

441
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,130
{\an8}查克yyds

442
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,080
{\an8}爱你查克

443
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,420
喂 喂 喂  你上哪去了？
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where have you been?

444
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,730
你不知道吗？我跑过来的
Are you kidding? I had to run here.

445
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,780
路全堵了 一半人把车都仍路上了
The traffic's insane, and half the cars are empty.

446
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,910
温斯顿医生跑了
Dr. Winston's MIA.

447
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,600
-什么意思？ -你没听错
-What? -Yeah.

448
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,950
他今天早上过来看了一圈转头就走了
He walked in this morning, and he looked around and he walked out again.

449
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,480
再也找不到他了
And now I can't find him.

450
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,440
他把对讲机都扔门口了
He dropped his pager when he walked out.

451
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,740
好 那我来开刀
Okay. I'll scrub in.

452
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,090
床位都空了
The beds are empty.

453
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,680
病人基本都自己走出去了 我把最后一个扶出去的
Most of them walked out. I-I-I transferred the last of the stable ones.

454
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,090
但是 菲莉西娅 有点怪事
But, Felicia, there's something weird.

455
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,570
怎么回事？
What is that?

456
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,460
机子坏了吗？
What's wrong with the monitor?

457
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,410
这就是怪事 不只这一台
That's the thing, it-it's, it's not just that one.

458
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,110
我搞不懂 小菲 搞不懂
I don't know, Fel. I don't know.

459
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,590
我 我也不想待在这了
I mean... I might want to get out of here.

460
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,850
我想回家
I might wanna go home.

461
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,090
没必要再待在这了
I don't think I need to be here anymore.

462
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,660
{\an8}信号中断

463
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,120
{\an8}菲莉西娅

464
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,190
{\an8}呼出失败 无信号

465
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,170
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹

466
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,320
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！

467
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,780
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

468
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,630
还好吗 老先生？
You okay, sir?

469
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,000
好 就歇歇脚
Yeah. Just taking a rest.

470
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,880
我走去市中心看大地坑了
I walked downtown to look at the sinkhole

471
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,930
还用手机拍了几张照片
and take a few pictures with my phone.

472
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,280
我以为电视台可能会想要
Thought one of the local TV stations might be interested,

473
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,540
但全都停播了
but they all seem to be off the air.

474
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,670
除了克兰兹的广告
Except for pictures of Krantz.

475
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,090
到处都是克兰兹啊
All Krantz all the time.

476
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,290
-知道他是谁吗？ -不知道
-Any idea who he is? -None.

477
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,650
我问过至少二十多人 没人知道
I've asked two dozen people, at least. Nobody knows.

478
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,130
克兰兹可是这个时代的幕后大佬啊
Our man, Krantz, is the Oz of the apocalypse.

479
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,910
只闻其名 不见其身啊
Our last meme.

480
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,310
-你往哪走？ -丰收里
-Where are you heading? -Harvest Acres.

481
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,610
世外桃源般的小区
Nice little enclave off the beaten track.

482
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,040
我正要去那儿
I'm heading there myself.

483
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,530
-我前妻住那儿 -噢
-My ex lives there. -Huh.

484
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,820
好吧
Well...

485
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,250
要一起去吗？
I can walk with you if you like.

486
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,540
山姆 你做什么工作的？
What do you do, Sam?

487
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,950
如果还有工作的话
If you still do anything, I mean.

488
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,420
亚伯勒殡仪馆的老板兼首席殡葬师
Owner and chief undertaker for Yarborough Funeral Home.

489
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,980
噢 老天
Oh, man!

490
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,240
是啊
Yeah.

491
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,680
生意之前好到爆
We had a boom.

492
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,990
谈起这个就高兴
It's hard to feel good about it,

493
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,380
最火的还是前几周
but business was never better than it was a few weeks ago.

494
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,780
但我真正志向所在是气象学
But my real interest's meteorology.

495
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,210
年轻时我曾想当电视上天气预报员
Dreamed of being a television weatherman in my salad days,

496
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,780
也许能成全国台的
maybe even one of the networks.

497
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,050
但 没成
But n-no.

498
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,960
不过还继续关注着
I keep up, though.

499
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,530
读有关的书
Read the journals.

500
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:37,100
想听的话 有些我读到的奇闻异事
And I can tell you something amazing if you want to hear.

501
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,110
大家都说一天有24小时 对吧？
You know how people say there are 24 hours in a day?

502
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,040
其实他们错了
Well, they're wrong.

503
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:51,550
在恒星日中一天有23小时零56分钟
There were 23 hours and 56 minutes in a stellar day.

504
00:28:53,410 --> 00:29:00,880
{\an8}查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
39个峥嵘岁月！
谢谢你 查克！

505
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,320
还零几秒钟
Plus a few odd seconds.

506
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,020
你说的是过去吧？
There "were"?

507
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,160
根据我的计算
Based on my calculations,

508
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,930
相信我 我的数学很好
which I assure you I can back up, my math is good,

509
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:11,400
现在一天有24小时零2分钟长
there are now 24 hours and two minutes in a day.

510
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,270
知道这什么意思？
Do you know what that means?

511
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,440
地球自转速度在减慢？
Well, you're saying the Earth's rotation is slowing down?

512
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,440
没错
Exactly.

513
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,190
很多人将这些灾难归咎于我们破坏环境
Lot of folks think all of these disasters are 'cause of what we've done to the environment.

514
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,950
并非如此
Not so.

515
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,630
我先承认 我们对待母亲非常坏
I'm the first to admit, we treated our mother,

516
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,420
是的 地球母亲 万物之母
yes, she's our mother, all of us, very badly.

517
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,680
我们肯定玷污了她 几近强暴
Certainly molested her, if not outright raped her.

518
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:41,860
但比起宇宙那浩瀚机制 我们只不过是一粒尘埃
But... we're puny compared to the great clock of the universe.

519
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,120
是呀
No.

520
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,000
不论是什么原因
Whatever's happening

521
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,870
问题绝对比环境恶化更大
is much larger than environmental degradation.

522
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,570
这就是数学告诉我的
The math says so.

523
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,530
数学能做很多事
And, and math can do a lot of things.

524
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:01,340
数学可以是门艺术 但数学可不会撒谎
I mean, math can be art... but it can't lie.

525
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,800
{\an8}丰收里小区

526
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,240
你看 我要先坐会儿
You know what? I think I'll sit

527
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:17,940
边欣赏日落 边歇歇脚
and enjoy the sunset while I wait for the arthritis to settle a bit.

528
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,250
要一起坐会儿吗？
You care to join me?

529
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,180
我还想继续走
I think I'll go on.

530
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,820
你前妻 我理解
The ex. I understand.

531
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,200
好的 一路顺风 安德森先生
Well, it was nice speaking with you, Mr. Anderson.

532
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,720
你好
Hey.

533
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,680
你好
Hey.

534
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,180
别怕 我正去我前妻那儿 菲莉西娅·安德森
Don't worry. I'm going to see my ex-wife, Felicia Anderson.

535
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,880
她现在改回娘家姓戈登了
I think she's back to Gordon now.

536
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,970
她住在费恩巷19号
She lives on Fern Lane, number 19.

537
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,420
是的 我认识戈登小姐
Yeah, I know Miss Gordon.

538
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,230
你大晚上出来干嘛？
What are you doing out?

539
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,950
溜旱冰
I wanted to go skating.

540
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,640
以前我特别喜欢溜旱冰
I used to love skating.

541
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,790
那现在就该就去溜
Then you should go skating.

542
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,510
也许我真该去溜
Maybe I should.

543
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,600
你都跟戈登小姐分手了 咋还去见她？
Why do you see Miss Gordon if she's your ex?

544
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,560
我还是喜欢她
I still like her.

545
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,060
你们吵架吗？
Do you fight?

546
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,960
以前吵
We used to.

547
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,050
分手后 我们相处得更好了
We get along better now that we're exes.

548
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,380
戈登小姐有时会来送她烤的姜饼干
Miss Gordon gives us gingersnap cookies sometimes.

549
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,200
我其实更喜欢奥利奥 不过...
I like Oreos better, but...

550
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,070
就像是盒巧克力 不能每颗都合心意 对吧？
That's just the way the cookie crumbles, right?

551
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,640
姜饼干里没巧克力
Gingersnaps don't crumble.

552
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,850
除非和奥利奥一起吃...
At least not until you crunch them...

553
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,540
你抓紧回家吧
You better go home, I guess.

554
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,620
没路灯 天太黑 没法溜
It's too dark for skating without streetlights.

555
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,230
会没事吗？
Is everything gonna be okay?

556
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,880
当然会
Sure it is.

557
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,130
{\an8}谢谢你 查克！

558
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,920
回家去
Go home.

559
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,860
回家去找你爸妈
Go home to your Mom and Dad.

560
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,560
抓紧
Do it now.

561
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,450
哦 谢天谢地 谢天谢地
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

562
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,640
-谢天谢地 -这些都 都...
-Thank God. -They, they just...

563
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,090
这些都突然冒出来了
They just, they just started showing up.

564
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,810
我知道 我知道 我也看到了
No, I know, I know, I saw.

565
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,970
只是这个小区吗？
Is it just here?

566
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,440
我觉得到处都有
I think it's everywhere.

567
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,330
看起来时候到了
I think it's almost...

568
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,430
是啊
Yeah...

569
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,860
是的 时候到了
Yeah, I think it's almost...

570
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,780
这是我见过的最亮的星空
It's the brightest I've ever seen the stars.

571
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,450
看那里
Just look at that.

572
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,230
那是天鹰座
There's Aquila the eagle.

573
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,680
嗯
Mm-hm.

574
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,420
那是...
There's, uh...

575
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,950
天鹅座
Cygnus the swan.

576
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,750
你看到了吗？
You see it?

577
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,970
那是北极...
And there's the North Sta...

578
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,700
你看到刚才那个吗？
Did you just see that?

579
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,340
看到了
Yeah.

580
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,720
火星也没了
There goes Mars.

581
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,510
我好怕
I'm scared.

582
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,340
我也是
I am too.

583
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
没事的 亲爱的
It's okay, honey.

584
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,880
你先走一步
You go on.

585
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:52,610
我们到那里再重逢
You go on ahead, okay?

586
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,440
活了才39年
Just thirty-nine years.

587
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,640
是39个峥嵘岁月
Thirty-nine great years.

588
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,150
谢谢你 查克
Thanks, Chuck.

589
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,420
我爱...
I love y...

590
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,500
{\an8}第二幕

591
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,690
{\an8}第二幕
街头艺人万岁

592
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,410
多亏她那开着旧面包车的朋友麦克帮忙
With the help of her friend, Mac, who has an old van,

593
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,820
泰勒·弗兰克才能把架子鼓摆到
Taylor Franck sets up her drum kit in

594
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,110
第八街长廊上她最喜欢的那个地方
her favored spot on the Eighth Street Promenade.

595
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,180
这天是周四下午
It's Thursday afternoon.

596
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,050
这天的天气 真是绝了
The weather is fucking gorgeous,

597
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,100
街上人来人往 大家都在幻想着周末
and the streets are thronged with people looking forward to the weekend,

598
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,060
毕竟幻想总比现实好
which is always better than the weekend itself.

599
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,540
-泰勒 都差不多了吧？ -嗯 谢了
-All good. Taylor? -Yeah, thanks.

600
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,500
老铁 别忘分我一成收入
Ten percent is all the thanks I want, dude.

601
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:45,950
泰勒和麦克都在城堡街的心疗唱片店打零工
Taylor, and Mac too, work part-time at Doctor Records on Castle Street.

602
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,150
打赏多时 泰勒挣得差不多跟打零工一样
But on a good day Taylor can make almost as much busking.

603
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,340
{\an8}魔术帽
每笔打赏都会精彩翻倍

604
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,810
当初考上茱莉亚时 她爸妈可没料到她会上街打鼓
Busk-drumming isn't what her parents saw for her when she enrolled at Juilliard,

605
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:05,080
{\an9}【茱莉亚学院是世界顶尖的音乐学校】

606
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,020
更不知道她现在还辍了学
and they don't know yet that she dropped out.

607
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,680
在茱莉亚他们教你多动脑子
Juilliard wanted you to think about what you were doing,

608
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:14,940
在泰勒眼里 跟着鼓点走就对了 多想一下灵感就跑了
but as far as Taylor is concerned, the beat is your friend and thinking is the enemy.

609
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,410
她先热身 一开始节奏简单
She starts warming up, going easy at first.

610
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,200
节奏缓慢 不敲牛铃
slow tempo, no cowbell,

611
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,600
不在乎魔术帽空着 里面只有她自己放的钱
not minding that the magic hat stays empty except for her two crumpled dollars

612
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:35,390
还有个滑板小子随随便便丢进去的硬币
and a quarter flipped contemptuously by a dude on a skateboard.

613
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,210
时间还早 总能找到切入点
There is time. There is a way in.

614
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,520
找到切入点才是占最大头的乐趣
Finding the in is half the fun. Maybe even most of it.

615
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:52,270
珍妮丝·哈利迪在书店工作一天后正在回家
Janice Halliday is on her way home from seven hours at Paper and Page,

616
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,450
大概会去海边走走
and may walk all the way to the ocean.

617
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,100
谈了一年多的男友刚甩了她
Her boyfriend of 16 months just broke up with her,

618
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,570
随便发个消息甩了她
and he did it the modern way.

619
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,700
{\an7}女：怎么不回我消息了？
男：咱俩不合适 你是个好人 继续做朋友？？

620
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,980
王八蛋！
Motherfucker!

621
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,030
这突如其来 犹如当头一棒把门关在脸上
It was totally unexpected, like having a door slammed in your face just as you were getting ready to walk through it.

622
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,590
-那感觉... -真他妈离谱
-It was... -Fucking bullshit!

623
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,160
...真他妈离谱
...fucking bullshit.

624
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,430
她从没动过真情 也没天真地以为自己爱过他
She isn't in love with him. never even kidded herself that she was.

625
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,300
-但依然... -他喵的糟透了
-But still it... -Fucking sucks.

626
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,610
...打她个措手不及
...is a dismaying shock just the same.

627
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,650
她打算回家后喝点酒 顺便哭一场
She supposes she'll have some wine when she gets home and cry.

628
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,090
说不定还会播个爵士乐 在屋里醉舞一番
Maybe queue up one of her big band playlists and dance drunk around the room.

629
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,880
她读高中时就爱跳舞
She loved to dance in high school.

630
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,800
也许能借此重温当年那份快乐
Maybe she can recapture a little of that happiness.

631
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,030
-去你妈的 -说什么？
-Fucking really?! -Excuse me.

632
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,520
对不起 对不起 没说你 没说你
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Not you, not you.

633
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,960
他喵的！
Fuck!

634
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,520
查克的拿铁好了
Got an oat milk latte for Chuck.

635
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,650
{\an8}查克 ^v^

636
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,320
查尔斯·查克·克兰兹
Charles Krantz,

637
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,330
在朋友眼中 他总一身会计行头
Chuck to his friends, is dressed in the armor of accountancy.

638
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,950
灰西装 蓝衬衣配蓝领带
Gray suit, blue shirt, blue tie.

639
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,950
脚上那双温莎牌皮鞋虽不贵 却耐穿
His Samuel Windsor shoes are inexpensive but sturdy.

640
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:11,220
他来这参加个主题为“二十一世纪银行业”的研讨会
He's here for a week-long conference titled "Banking in the 21st Century."

641
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,960
他的中西部信托银行派他来的
He's been sent by his bank, Midwest Trust,

642
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,880
全程报销
all expenses paid.

643
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,750
查克对嘉宾和座谈都挺有兴趣
Chuck has enjoyed the speakers and the panels.

644
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,320
他上过一个座谈会
He was on one panel

645
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,370
明天中午大会结束前还要再参加一个
and is scheduled to be on another before the conference ends at noon tomorrow,

646
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:33,760
但他可不想下班后还和那群同行混在一起
but has no wish to spend his off-duty hours in the company of 70 other accountants.

647
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,120
他精通会计的那套行话 也觉得自己能融入别的圈子
He speaks their language, but likes to think he speaks others as well.

648
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,940
至少曾经那么自信 如今却大不如前了
At least he did, although some of the vocabulary is now lost.

649
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,000
现在 他穿着他温莎牌牛津鞋正在午后散步
Now, his sensible Samuel Windsor Oxfords are taking him for an afternoon walk.

650
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,050
现在的生活没能达到最初的设想
His life is narrower than the one he once hoped for,

651
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,410
可他已经释然了
but he's made peace with that.

652
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,790
他明白水往低处流是自然规律
He understands that narrowing is the natural order of things.

653
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,410
他有个忠贞不渝的妻子叫珍妮
He has a wife, Ginny, to whom he is scrupulously faithful,

654
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,540
还有个聪明风趣的儿子上初中
and an intelligent, good-humored son in middle school.

655
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:18,190
他还有九个月可活 只不过他还不知道
He also has only nine months to live, though he doesn't know that yet.

656
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:28,940
泰勒已经敲了十分钟了 分文未得 毫无灵感
Taylor has been on the job for 10 minutes now and has nothing to show for it.

657
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,910
她看见个西装男朝她走来
She sees a Mr. Businessman type coming toward her

658
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,430
不知为何 他身上有股气息
and something about him, God knows what,

659
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,520
让泰勒忍不住大张旗鼓宣布他登场了
makes Taylor want to announce his approach.

660
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,060
她先用松弛的摇摆热场 又切换到更撩人的节奏
She slips first into a reggae beat, then something slinkier.

661
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,400
今天头一次 泰勒火花被点燃
And for the first time today, Taylor feels a spark

662
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,670
便在核心鼓点上敲着牛铃
and begins to whack the cowbell on the downbeat.

663
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,100
真带感
It's pretty cool.

664
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:02,920
鼓点已经到来 那律动带你一路向前
The groove has arrived, and the groove is like a road you want to follow.

665
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,680
她本可把节拍提快 玩点花样
She could speed the beat up, get some tom in there,

666
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:12,170
但此刻目光是那西装男 多此一举反而不搭
but she's watching Mr. Businessman and that seems wrong for this dude.

667
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:18,690
她以为那西装男只是路过 要去商务酒店
She believes Mr. Businessman will just go on past on his way to the business hotel,

668
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,870
等他一走 泰勒再换节拍
and when he's gone, Taylor will switch to something else.

669
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,030
可他却停下脚步
But instead of floating on by...

670
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,100
赏个脸
Come on.

671
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,020
来吧 小老妹
Come on, little sister.

672
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,720
来跳舞吧
Let's dance.

673
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,260
跳
Dance.

674
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,440
对了
Yeah!

675
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,060
我带你跳 有我别怕
I'll lead you. I got you.

676
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,880
啊
Uh.

677
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,250
没事 眼镜的事儿 眼镜的事儿
It's okay. It's my glasses. It's my glasses.

678
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,990
现在该做什么？
What are we doing?

679
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,820
我也不知道
I don't know.

680
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,690
大伙 今天就到这了
No more today, folks.

681
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,480
今天就到这了
No more today.

682
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,250
今天就到这了 得见好就收
No more today. We gotta quit while we're ahead.

683
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,820
{\an8}魔术帽
每笔打赏都会精彩翻倍

684
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,290
要搭把手吗
Do you need a-any help at all or...

685
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,810
好 帮把这个收起来
Here, can you, uh, take this?

686
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,420
-好 -拧这里
-Sure. -Just, just spin the thingy here.

687
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,470
-小心别夹手了 -会雨过天晴的
But watch out for your fingers. -It'll, it'll, it'll get 'em good.

688
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,300
懂了吧
you know what I mean?

689
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,500
-好 好 -找点事散散心
-Yeah, yeah. -To doing something else.

690
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,690
刚太神奇了
What just happened?

691
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,690
跳的太神了
That was incredible.

692
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,130
你们是舞蹈演员吗？
You dance for a living?

693
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,870
哦 不 不
No. Oh, no. I...

694
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,870
-不 不是的 -你做什么的？
-No, I do not, sir. -What do you do for a living?

695
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,850
哎呦 我好像不小心搞坏了
Oh, no, I think I... Did I... I didn't break it, did I?

696
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,070
这个好像坏了
I think he broke it.

697
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,840
去喷泉吧
Let's hit the pond.

698
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,170
那儿没停车位
We'll never find parking by the Common.

699
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,570
那也要停
We will today.

700
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,190
今天 就像魔术一样
Today...is magic.

701
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,470
你们在哪练的这身舞功？
Where did you learn to dance like that?

702
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
别 别 别 那是你赚的
Oh, no, no, no, that's yours.

703
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,010
不 有福同享
Nope, we split it even.

704
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:08,470
要我自己敲 一天也赚不了这么多
By myself, I wouldn't have made half as much if I drummed till midnight.

705
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,610
你没事吧？
You okay?

706
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,340
还好
Yeah.

707
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,690
就是有点头疼
Yeah. Just one of my headaches.

708
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,820
不了 不了 真用不着 你留着吧
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. I don't need it. You keep it.

709
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,260
来吧 老兄 你应得的
Come on, man, you earned it.

710
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,000
拿去吃顿饭 转手送人也行 但这钱我偏要交给你
Buy yourself dinner. Give it away. But I'm handing it to you.

711
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,400
你们干这行都能当职业了
You could do this for a living, you know?

712
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,360
我可不敢这么说
I don't know about that.

713
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,300
我真觉得靠街头表演 我们能红 能赚大钱
I really think we could busk our way to fame and fortune.

714
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,830
你怎么会停在我面前？
What made you stop in front of me?

715
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,620
又为什么突然跳起舞？
Why did you start moving?

716
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:08,470
他本可说鼓点让他想起他那不成气候的追旧青年乐队
He could say it was because he was thinking about his old half-assed band, The Retros,

717
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:14,370
他还喜欢跟着节奏跳舞
and how he liked to dance across the stage during instrumental breaks.

718
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,160
但他没这么说
But that's not it.

719
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,760
我也说不清
I don't know.

720
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,960
泰勒 该走了
Taylor, we gotta roll,

721
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,450
不然你赚的钱都得交罚单了
or you're gonna end up spending your take on my parking ticket.

722
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,060
你们不考虑转行跳舞吗？
So, you guys don't want a career change?

723
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,970
转行？
Career change? How... I mean...

724
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,280
我们肯定能闯出名堂
We'll make a name for ourselves.

725
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,980
别急着走 先进来一下
You got to get in here before you go.

726
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,070
-来个大团抱！ -哦 哦 好
-Group hug. -Oh, oh, okay.

727
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,400
-大团抱！ -来
-Group hug. -Okay.

728
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,980
快 快 快
Go.

729
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,600
来 来
Come on.

730
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,860
街头艺人万岁
Buskers forever.

731
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,430
好了 好了
Yeah. Buskers forever.

732
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,690
得赶在贴罚单前抓紧走
We gotta roll before the meter maid shows up.

733
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,610
真替你难过
I'm so sorry.

734
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,310
真倒霉
That sucks.

735
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,290
这确实倒霉
It does suck.

736
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,880
我真觉得他人还不错
I thought he was a nice guy.

737
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,420
床上功夫也到位 我们在一起挺开心的
He was a pretty good lover, and we had fun and all that.

738
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,370
我回去得找下我们跳舞的视频 估计会上热搜
If I can find a video of us dancing, which I'm gonna look because I bet we go viral,

739
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:29,940
然后转发给他 再附句“这就是你错过的缘分”
I'm gonna send it to him with a text, a text that says, "This is what you're missing."

740
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,680
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

741
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,710
我不是全都懂 可这件事我很清楚
I don't know a lot, but I know that much.

742
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:52,640
光辉就在你前面 往前迈一步乌云就消散
You got a bright sunbeam in front of you, and you're gonna step right into it, I can tell.

743
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,240
但现在
But yeah.

744
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,350
真倒霉 没啥好说的
It sucks. Not much else to say.

745
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,020
一切都完了 我们也只剩下句真倒霉
Everything goes down the drain, and all we can say is, "That sucks."

746
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,220
对
Yeah.

747
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,940
说不定谁都躲不掉这劫
Maybe we're going down the drain too.

748
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,640
说不定
Maybe.

749
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,420
我走这条路
I'm this way.

750
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,390
我往那边走
Uh, I'm that way.

751
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,620
多谢你陪我跳舞
Thank you for the dance.

752
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:27,360
当他走过泰勒摆鼓的地方
As he passes the place where Taylor set up her drums,

753
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,430
那两个问题又冒了出来
those two questions recur.

754
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,280
为什么要停下脚步听？
Why did he stop to listen?

755
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:41,270
又为什么要跳起舞？
And why did he start to dance?

756
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,130
他自己也想不通
He doesn't know.

757
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:51,210
有答案能让这回忆更动人吗？
And would answers make a good thing better?

758
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,910
后来 他走路都成问题
Later, he'll lose the ability to walk,

759
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,740
和那个小老妹跳舞成了个传说
never mind dancing with little sister on the promenade.

760
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,140
再后来 他咀嚼都成了难题
Later, he'll lose the ability to chew food.

761
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,190
再后来 他记不住妻子的名字
Later, he'll forget his wife's name.

762
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:14,150
到最后 他分不清白日黑夜
Later, he'll lose his grip on the difference between waking and sleeping

763
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:23,160
陷入一种让人质疑生命意义的巨大痛苦中
and enter a land of pain so great he will wonder why God made the world.

764
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:30,080
但有时 他还会记得当初把公文包一丢
What he will remember, occasionally, is how he stopped and dropped his briefcase

765
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,690
跟着鼓点起舞的感觉
and began to move his hips to the beat of the drums.

766
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:40,830
他会觉得 这就是上帝让世界存在的意义
And he will think that is why God made the world.

767
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,930
仅此而已
Just that.

768
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,390
{\an8}第一幕

769
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:04,160
{\an8}第一幕
我包罗万象

770
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,940
查克一直盼着能有个小妹妹
Chuck was looking forward to having a baby sister.

771
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,950
更盼着父母能赶紧回来
Of course, he was also looking forward to having parents,

772
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:22,070
谁料95号高架上结的冰让一切化为泡影
but none of that worked out thanks to a patch 95 of well-hidden ice on an I-95 overpass.

773
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,130
事发时查克没在车上
Chuck wasn't in the car when it happened

774
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,920
他父母去享受二人世界
because his parents were having a dinner date

775
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,360
那天晚上他爷爷奶奶带他
and he was being babysat by his grandparents,

776
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,270
他那会儿还叫他们阿爷阿奶
who, at the time, he was still calling Zaydee and Bubbie.

777
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,860
{\an9}【Zaydee和Bubbie是东欧犹太移民常用的祖父母称呼】

778
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,840
他那时七岁了
He was seven years old.

779
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,920
真赞喔
Excellent job.

780
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:46,070
一年半载 屋子里全是悲伤
For a year and a half, it was a house of unadulterated sadness.

781
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,990
对阿尔比和莎拉·克兰兹来说 不只是儿子和儿媳没了
Albie and Sarah Krantz had not only lost their son and daughter-in-law...

782
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,470
咋不吃饭了？
Why're you not eating?

783
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:57,070
那本该三个月后出生的孙女也没了
...they had lost the granddaughter who would've been born just three months later.

784
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,770
咋回事儿？
What's going on?

785
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,080
名字都选好了...
The name had already been picked out...

786
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,520
-她叫艾雨莎 -艾雨莎
-Her name is Alyssa. -...Alyssa.

787
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,060
查克说那名字听着像下雨时
When Chuck said that sounded to him like rain,

788
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,130
他妈哭笑不得
his mother had laughed and cried at the same time.

789
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,430
他永远忘不了那表情
He never forgot that.

790
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:19,800
阿尔比靠两件事来排解悲伤
Albie processed his grief by turning to his two absolutes,

791
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,190
算账和喝酒
numbers and alcohol.

792
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:28,110
但对莎拉来说 一切却都失去了滋味
Sarah, though, could find no joy in her usual pleasures.

793
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,980
曾让她陶醉的音乐 艺术和美食
She loved the flavors of life, music, art, and food,

794
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,500
如今都索然无味
but now, found the world quiet and gray and flavorless.

795
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,860
随着时间流逝 家里又慢慢有了些温暖
Some of the good feelings came back into the house with time.

796
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,480
事故后全靠外卖度日
There were a lot of takeout meals after the accident,

797
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:53,740
但查克快十岁那年 他奶奶又重新下厨
but around the time Chuck turned 10, his grandma started cooking again.

798
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,590
她做饭时爱放摇滚乐
She liked rock-and-roll while she was cooking.

799
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:05,600
查克肯定觉得太潮了 可她显然乐在其中
Music Chuck would've thought much too young for her, but which she clearly enjoyed.

800
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:27,440
来吧 小老弟 来跳舞吧
Come on, little brother, let's dance.

801
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,790
{\an8}《西区故事》

802
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,110
{\an8}《雨中曲》

803
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,730
{\an8}《歌厅》

804
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,980

805
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,230
{\an8}《封面女郎》

806
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,510
{\an9}【电影《封面女郎》(1944)】

807
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:27,380
小宝 你有本事学会 你天生是跳舞的料
You could learn those moves, kiddo. You're a natural.

808
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,790
你在哪学的？
Wh-Where did you learn?

809
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,640
高中
High school.

810
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,320
你上高中的时候是什么样的？
What were you like in high school?

811
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,670
我可是个小辣妹
I was a kusit.

812
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,665
{\an9}【Kusit为希伯来语】

813
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,210
千万别把我这话告诉你阿爷哦
But don't you tell your Zaydee I said that.

814
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,090
他是个老古董
He's old school, that one.

815
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,320
查克守口如瓶
Chuck never told.

816
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:50,870
他把爷爷奶奶家处处都当自己家
His grandparents' house became every inch his home

817
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:56,370
除了塔尖阁楼
with one exception. the cupola on the roof.

818
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,930
查克被严令禁止进那阁楼
Chuck was forbidden to go into the cupola.

819
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:08,360
那是他爷爷的一条铁律 不容置疑
That was his grandfather's rule, and it was absolute, emphatic.

820
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,750
他爷爷阿尔比做事宽容
Albie wasn't a stern man in other matters.

821
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:15,060
平时人挺温和的
He was downright gentle in most respects.

822
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,540
偏偏在这事上绝不讲情面
But on this point, he was rigid.

823
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:24,230
查克可不止问过一次
Chuck asked about it, of course, and more than once.

824
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,240
那上头有什么？从高高的窗户能看到啥？
What was up there? What could you see from the high window?

825
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,310
最重要的是 为啥老是锁着？
And the big question, why was the room locked?

826
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,370
他奶奶说...
Grandma said...

827
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,880
楼上地板不结实 一踩就会坍下去
Because the floor isn't safe and you might go right through it.

828
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:37,820
他爷爷说...
Grandpa said...

829
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,080
由于那烂地板 屋子里空无一物
There's nothing up there because of that rotten floor.

830
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,960
你往窗外瞅 也就只能看到商场
And the only thing you can see through the windows is the shopping center.

831
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:50,390
他一直这么说 直到查克十一岁生日前一晚
He said that until, one night, just before Chuck's 11th birthday,

832
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,170
他才吐出部分实情
when he told at least part of the truth.

833
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,790
{\an7}宇宙历年法
The cosmic calendar

834
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:59,540
{\an7}把宇宙的历史压缩到一本365天日历
compresses the local history of the universe into a single year.

835
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,100
{\an7}从1月1日宇宙诞生算起
If the universe began on January 1st,

836
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,900
{\an7}我们的银河系要到5月才出现
it was not until May that the Milky Way formed.

837
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,720
俗话说酒后吐真言
Drinking is not good for secrets.

838
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,160
当儿子 儿媳还有那个名字听着像下雨的
And after the death of his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter-to-be,

839
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,880
未来孙女艾雨莎全都去世后
Alyssa, who sounds like rain,

840
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,210
阿尔比·克兰兹就拼命喝酒
Albie Krantz drank a great deal.

841
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:22,430
{\an7}人类全部的历史
Everything humans have ever done occurred in that bright speck

842
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:26,590
{\an7}都在这本日历的最后一天
at the lower right of the cosmic calendar.

843
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:31,960
我打赌 从阁楼往外看 能看到西福商场
I'll bet you could see way past the Westford Mall from the cupola.

844
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,360
整座小镇肯定也能看得一清二楚
You gotta be able to see the whole town from up there, I bet.

845
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:43,710
要真上去了 你看见的可不只是风景
If you went up there, you might see a lot more than you wanted.

846
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,110
小查 这门紧锁是有原因的
That's why it's locked, Chucko.

847
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,370
{\an7}日历里每个月代表12.5亿年
Every month is one and a quarter billion years long.

848
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,910
{\an7}每一天代表4000万年
Each day represents 40 million years.

849
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,210
他想问清楚
He wanted to ask what Grandpa meant.

850
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:59,160
尽管他才10岁
But the adult part of him, not there in person, no, not at 10,

851
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:04,070
可脑子里的成熟声音冒出来
but something that had begun to speak on rare occasions,

852
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:11,860
告诉他别吭声 安静地等着
told him to be quiet. Be quiet and wait.

853
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,220
{\an7}人类的全部历史就像我手掌那么大
But all of human history would occupy an area the size of my hand.

854
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,290
{\an7}现在让我们回到太古时代...
We're just beginning to trace the long and tortuous path which began with the primeval...

855
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,490
你知道这房子是什么风格的吗？
You know what style of house this is?

856
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,010
维多利亚风格
Victorian.

857
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,790
没错
That's right.

858
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:34,370
可不是仿古的 1885年建的正经维多利亚式
And not pretend Victorian either. It was built in 1885.

859
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,420
后来翻新过大概六次吧
It's been remodeled half a dozen times since.

860
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,340
可那阁楼一直保留至今
But that cupola was there from the start.

861
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,860
我七十年代初搬来
Been here since '71.

862
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,310
搬来至今 我上那阁楼都没到六次
And in all those years, I haven't been up to that damn cupola half a dozen times.

863
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,950
因为地板烂了？
'Cause the floor is rotted?

864
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,820
因为闹鬼
'Cause it's full of ghosts.

865
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,490
{\an7}...发生在12月31日的晚上10点30分
...around 10:30 p.m. on December 31st.

866
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,270
-还记得圣诞述异那个故事吗？ -嗯
-Y-You remember Scrooge? -Yeah.

867
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,950
那部叫做《圣诞欢歌》的电影？
That Scrooge movie we watched?

868
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,270
记得
I remember.

869
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:09,930
你觉得那算鬼故事吗？
Do you think of that as a ghost story?

870
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,630
算吧
I-I-I guess so.

871
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:15,340
有人说那是鬼故事
Heard someone say it was a ghost story.

872
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:22,000
他吓的说“圣诞节未卜先知”
Christmas Yet to Come.

873
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:24,620
{\an7}晚上11点59分20秒...
11:59:20, evening, last day of the...

874
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,860
杰弗里家那男孩一个月后就没了
Jefferies boy was a month later.

875
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:39,740
亨利·彼得森拖得久些 等了四五年
Henry Peterson, that took longer. Four...maybe five years on.

876
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:47,520
到那时 阁楼里看到的 我几乎忘得精光
And by then...I almost forgot what I saw up there.

877
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,400
几乎
Almost.

878
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,630
我说过再也不上去
Said I'd never go back up there after that.

879
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:03,120
真不想上去 要不是为了莎拉
And I wish I hadn't because of Sarah.

880
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,510
为了你的阿奶 小查
Because of your Bubbie, Chucky.

881
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:12,430
最疼你的阿奶
Your sweet Bubbie.

882
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,340
都是面包
And the bread.

883
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,940
{\an7}我们听说过的所有人...
Every person we've ever heard of, somewhere in there...

884
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,880
这就是等待 小查
It's the waiting, Chucko.

885
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:27,110
这是最难熬的
That's the hard part.

886
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:35,160
{\an7}所有历史书上的事 都只发生在这本日历最后10秒钟里
Everything in the history books happened here in the last 10 seconds of the cosmic calendar.

887
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,510
呜 外面真冷
Ooh! It's getting cold out there.

888
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:41,160
维拉向大家问好 还谢我煲的汤
Vera says hi. She says thanks for the soup.

889
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,280
她把八卦全抖给我 抖得可带劲了
She laid the gossip on me, laid it good.

890
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,350
当然 要不然咱咋离不开她呢
Of course...That's why we have a Vera, isn't it?

891
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,380
有什么新鲜事吗？
So, what's the latest?

892
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,730
知道吗 凯伦和马蒂在搞婚姻咨询
Well, I don't know if you've heard, but Trish is saying Karen and Matty are in therapy.

893
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:00,970
-搞什么？ -阿爷 亨利·彼得森到底是谁？
-Again. -Who's Henry Peterson, Zaydee?

894
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:03,000
{\an7}...珍惜我们的宇宙 不要辜负这150亿年
...the universe that made us or we can squander our 15 billion-year heritage.

895
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,080
再买点煎饼粉
And get some pancake mix.

896
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,770
要黄盒的 别买橙盒的 都记住了吗？
Yellow box, not the orange box. You got all that?

897
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,180
记住了
I got it.

898
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,960
-要我写下来吗？ -我记得住
-Do you need me to write it down? -I got it.

899
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,300
别开车 走路去能醒醒酒
Don't you think about driving. The walk will sober you up.

900
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:17,780
好 好 好
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,470
他去便利店了 一会儿就回来
He'll be back with some groceries.

902
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:43,340
要不今晚一起烤棉花糖？
Then, how about tonight, we do some s'mores in the fireplace?

903
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,570
随便
Yeah.

904
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,010
好吧
Yeah.

905
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:51,050
他是不是跟你说闹鬼的事了？
Was he blabbing to you about his ghosts?

906
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,550
阁楼里闹鬼的事？
The ones that live in the cupola?

907
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,490
是呀
Yeah.

908
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,700
是真的吗？
Well, are there?

909
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,400
你说呢？
What do you think?

910
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,060
别太信你阿爷
I wouldn't pay too much attention to Zaydee.

911
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:11,600
他人不错 就是有时喝得太多
He's a good man. But, sometimes, well, sometimes, he drinks too much.

912
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,770
喝多了就会天马行空 你懂他那一套
Then he rides his hobby horses. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

913
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,730
杰弗里家男孩是谁？
Who was the Jefferies boy?

914
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,110
好吧 小宝 那是件让人心酸的事
Well...that was a very sad thing, kiddo.

915
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,780
他住旁边那巷子
He lived on the next block over,

916
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:34,310
追球追到马路上结果被车撞了
and he got hit by a car when he chased a ball into the street.

917
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,810
那是很久前的事儿了
It happened a long time ago.

918
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:45,800
要是你爷爷说他提前见过那一幕 他并没有
And if your grandpa says he saw it before it happened, he's mistaken.

919
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,800
那只是他酒后乱说
He just drinks too much.

920
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:05,290
要不我帮你送到史坦利奶奶那儿？
You know, I could take those to Mrs. Stanley if you want.

921
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:09,900
哎呀 你真贴心 维拉看到你肯定特开心
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you. I bet Vera'd love that.

922
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,480
简直绝了
Just wonderful.

923
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,510
你奶奶真是个烘焙大师
Your, your grandmother is an artist.

924
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,310
谢谢你带来 你主动要来送的吧？
Thank you for bringing them over. Was that your idea?

925
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,050
-说实话哦 -是的
-Be honest. -It was.

926
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,700
要喝茶吗？
Well, can I make you a cup of tea?

927
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:27,390
其实我不喝茶 有杯牛奶就完美了
Um, I don't drink tea, but, um, I wouldn't mind a glass of milk.

928
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,100
你奶奶真是个大好人
Well, your grandmother's a saint.

929
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,470
你爷爷呢？
And what about your granddad?

930
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,650
他背上那东西去检查了吗？
Did he have that thing on his back looked at?

931
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,150
嗯 医生拿掉了 还做了化验
Yeah, the, the doctor took it off and had it tested.

932
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,850
全告诉我
Tell me everything.

933
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,550
不是坏的那种
It wasn't one of the bad ones.

934
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,290
谢天谢地
Thank God for that.

935
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,780
嗯
Yeah.

936
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:52,600
他跟奶奶聊那个叫亨利·彼得森的人
He, um, he was talking to Grandma about someone named Henry Peterson.

937
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,910
太惨了
So awful.

938
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,350
亨利跟你爷爷一样是管账的
You know, Henry was a bookkeeper, just like your granddad.

939
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:00,750
还接了镇上你阿爷扛不下的活儿...
He did a lot of the other businesses in town. The ones that your Zaydee didn't do...

940
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:03,170
到底怎么回事？
How did it happen?

941
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,750
这种事你还是别听了
I don't think you want to hear about that stuff.

942
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:11,550
呃 爷爷说 说那很平和
Um, w-w-well, Granddad said it was, uh, peaceful.

943
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,270
平和？
Peaceful?

944
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,190
他自尽了 上吊的
He killed himself. Hung himself.

945
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,890
他老婆跟个刚满十八的小伙子私奔了
His wife, you see, she ran off with this younger man, barely old enough to vote.

946
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:23,460
她自己都四十多了 你怎么看？
And she was in her 40s. What do you think of that?

947
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,030
-天哪 -对 可不是
-Wow. -Damn right, wow.

948
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,880
我还听说...
And then, I heard that...

949
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,180
学校那边有什么新鲜事？
What's happening at school?

950
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,470
谁和谁在亲亲啦？
Who's smooching who?

951
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:43,780
放心说吧 无人能闻得见 我只多留片刻
"Talk honestly, for no one else hears you and I stay only a minute longer."

952
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,790
我是否自相矛盾？
"Do I contradict myself?

953
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:51,570
好吧 那我就自相矛盾
"Very well then, I contradict myself,"

954
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:56,010
我心疆无限 我包罗万象
"I am large. I contain multitudes."

955
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,320
六年级的最后一堂课上
On the last day of sixth grade,

956
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:04,540
那位小清新气息 管不住课堂的理查兹老师
Miss Richards, a sweet, hippie-dippyish young woman who had no command of discipline

957
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,420
怕是很快就要被劝退
and would probably not last long in the public education system,

958
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:17,770
还是在查克班上照念惠特曼《自我之歌》的诗
tried to recite for Chuck's class some verse of Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself."

959
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:21,260
若最初寻我不得 莫失信心
"Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged.

960
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:25,440
错过此处 再觅它方
Missing me one place, search another."

961
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,140
这节课还算顺利 对吧？
That went well, don't you think?

962
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,830
嗯 让您为难了
Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry about that.

963
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:54,380
惠特曼那句“我心疆无限 我包罗万象”是啥意思？
What does he mean when he says, "I am large, I contain multitudes"?

964
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,730
你觉得他想表达什么？
What do you think he means?

965
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,090
包罗他认识的所有人
All the people he knows.

966
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,520
对
Yes.

967
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,050
但也许不止于此
But maybe he means even more.

968
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,870
来 过来
Here. Come here.

969
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,780
我的两手之间 那里有什么？
What's in there? Between my hands?

970
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,570
我头
My brain.

971
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:16,790
不 不是这个意思
No, um, that's not exactly what I mean.

972
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:22,010
我是说 在我两手之间 里面装的是什么
What's in there? Right between my hands right now.

973
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,180
我不知道
I don't know.

974
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,260
里面有你认识的所有人吗？
All the people you know?

975
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,800
有吧
I guess.

976
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,780
就只有你认识的人吗？
Just the people you know?

977
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,460
里面是你见过的记住的一切
Everything you see. Everything you know.

978
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,570
是整个世界 查克
The world, Chuck.

979
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,290
天上的飞机 地上的井盖
Planes in the sky. Manhole covers in the street.

980
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,430
年复一年 你脑海中的世界
Every year that you live, that world inside your head

981
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:49,130
会越来越大 越鲜明 越丰富 越复杂
will get bigger and brighter and more detailed and complex.

982
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:52,780
你会在脑海中构建城市 国家 大陆
You will build cities and countries and continents,

983
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,650
并用真实和想象的人去充实那里
and you will fill them with people and faces, real and imagined.

984
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,070
明白了吗？
Do you understand?

985
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,790
别就此止步
Don't stop there.

986
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:06,240
把你见过的 认识的
You fill the whole thing with everyone you ever meet,

987
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,750
甚至想象的每个人都给装进去
everyone you ever know, everyone you ever just imagine.

988
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,760
它就变成了个小宇宙
It'll be a universe.

989
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:20,330
整个宇宙就在我两手之间
A whole universe right between my hands.

990
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:25,850
你能包罗万象
You contain multitudes.

991
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,960
那
So...

992
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:33,260
那个宇宙会怎样 要是有人
what happens to that universe if someone...

993
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,440
比如说
I don't know,

994
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:41,790
在冰面上打滑 冲下高架桥 或者
hits a patch of ice and goes off an overpass or...

995
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,790
别太纠结这些
Don't worry too much about those things.

996
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:50,320
只要记住 你包罗万象 查克
Just remember that you contain multitudes, Chuck.

997
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,770
这多棒啊
Isn't that wonderful?

998
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,450
好了 就这样 你真是个好孩子
Now, go on. You were such a good boy.

999
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,410
能教你我很开心
I've really enjoyed having you in class.

1000
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,440
查克暑假本来过得挺好 直到八月
Chuck did enjoy his summer until August,

1001
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,690
他阿奶去世了
when Bubbie died.

1002
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,400
事情发生在街角的便利店里
It happened at the grocery store down the street,

1003
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:37,150
公开场合 有点不太体面
in public, which was a little undignified,

1004
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:41,250
至少这种死法能让人安心地说...
but at least it was the kind of death where people can safely say...

1005
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,070
幸好她一生没受什么罪
Thank God she didn't suffer.

1006
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,560
至于那句...
The other standby...

1007
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,390
她一生又长又圆满
She had a long, full life.

1008
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:50,160
就说不准了
...was more of a gray area.

1009
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,620
毕竟她才六十多岁
Sarah Krantz had yet to reach her mid-60s.

1010
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:03,720
又一次 家里再次陷入彻底的悲伤
Once more, the house on Pilchard Street was one of unadulterated sadness.

1011
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:07,800
阿尔比戴上了黑纱 越发消瘦
Albie wore his mourning band, and lost weight,

1012
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:10,220
也不再讲笑话了
and stopped telling his jokes

1013
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,930
比他实际七十岁还显老
and began to look older than his 70 years.

1014
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:24,370
-就买这点？ -嗯
-That's it? -Yeah.

1015
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,980
一块七毛五
Buck 75.

1016
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:35,340
几周前来的那个女士 就是后来去世的那位
Um, that lady who was in here a few weeks ago, the one who died.

1017
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,780
事情发生在哪儿？
Where was she when it happened?

1018
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,380
小朋友 这话题有点吓人
That's a little creepy, kid.

1019
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:45,430
她是我奶奶
She was my grandma.

1020
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,060
她当时想拿面包
She was getting a loaf of bread.

1021
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,620
结果把整排货架都拽倒砸她身上了
Pulled down almost everything on the shelf when she collapsed.

1022
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,250
要是我说多了 你别介意
I'm sorry if that's too much information.

1023
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,630
没事
Nah.

1024
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:03,720
我早知道了
I already knew that.

1025
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,160
-别！ -啥？
-No! -What?!

1026
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:05,830
-走开 快走开 -等下
-Get away from there! You get away from there. -What? Hey, hey!

1027
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:30,070
把锁给我
Give me that.

1028
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,930
给我 给我
Give it to me. Give it to me.

1029
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:36,520
抓紧给我
Give me it.

1030
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:42,420
哦 对不起
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

1031
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

1032
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,870
你没受伤吧
Are you okay?

1033
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:48,730
你看到了什么？
What did you see?

1034
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,650
到底看到了什么？
What did you see?

1035
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:55,610
对不起 你不能去那里
I'm sorry. It's just, you can't.

1036
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:58,570
绝不能去那里 小查
You can't do that, Chucky.

1037
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:00,260
绝不能
You just can't.

1038
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,100
哦 我真对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1039
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:08,070
哦 对不起 真的 真是对不起
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I'm sorry.

哎呦 今年居然有三个男孩 破纪录了
What do you know? Three boys this year. It's a new record.

1045
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:00,150
小先生们别怕被取笑
You gentlemen might find yourselves being teased for your new hobby.

I assure you, you are the smartest young men in the whole school.

You'll soon see what I mean.

1048

不认识我的同学们 我是罗巴赫老师
For those who don't know me, I am Miss Rohrbacher.

1049
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:13,770
在女子体育课外 我被尊称为...
And when I'm not teaching the girls phys-ed,  I am what a few students have called,

1050
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,470
舞林怪才
"The Dance Monster."

1051
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,300
没反应？好吧
Nothing? Alright.

1052
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,170
你们加入的社团堪称学校最牛的
You have chosen what might be the best club this school has ever had.

1053
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:25,310
与女排社团并驾齐驱
'Cause if we didn't have girls volleyball, we wouldn't have nothing.

1054
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,350
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1055

他是这小社团里跳的最好的
He was, by far, the best dancer in the little club.

1067
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:09,960
老师常让他和不会跳的女生搭档
So, Miss Rohrbacher mostly put him with the girls who were clumsy.

1068
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:15,180
他明白老师的用意 也乐意帮忙
He understood she did it to make them better, and he was a good sport about it.

1069
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,750
快下课前
Near the end of their two hours, however,

1070
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:23,100
舞林怪才才心软 让他和凯特·麦考伊搭档
The Dance Monster would show mercy and pair him with Cat McCoy,

1071
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,890
她八年级 也是所有女生里跳得最溜的
who was an eighth grader and the best dancer of the girls.

1072
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,630
查克可没动她的心思
Chuck didn't expect romance.

1073
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:36,640
卡特确实漂亮 不过也比他高一头
Cat was not only gorgeous, she was a full foot taller than he was.

1074
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:41,770
但他很喜欢和她一起跳 她也有同感
But he loved to dance with her, and the feeling was mutual.

1075
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,430
...外 二 三 转
...three. Out, two, three. Switch.

1076
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,250
好 停
And stop.

1077
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:48,870
内 二 三 外 二 三
In, two, three. Out, two, three.

1078
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,600
转 换箱步
Turn. Now box.

1079
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:56,920
一 二 三 一 二 三
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1080
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,270
看 你 们 跳 的 啥
I don't know what that is.

1081
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,880
老 天 呐
Oh, my God.

1082
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,610
算了 自由练十分钟
Okay, 10 minutes freestyle.

1083
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,780
嘿 瞧好
Hey. Watch this.

1084
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,080
快教我
Show me how you did that.

1085
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,560
看好
Ready?

1086
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,520
滑 滑 滑
Slide, slide, slide.

1087
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,650
来试试
Here, ready?

1088
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,130
来跟我学
Try it with me.

1089
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,960
不行 把鞋脱了 穿袜子滑
Uh, kick off your shoes and do it in your socks.

1090
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:48,640
遵命
Aye-aye.

1091
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,280
滑右脚
Now, slide.

1092
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,270
滑左脚
Slide.

1093
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:55,620
看 你学会了
Yeah. There you go.

1094
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:59,670
来 让我看看
Hey! Show me.

1095
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,160
停 滑 停 滑 滑 滑
Pop. Slide. Pop. Slide. Slide. Slide.

1096
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,550
再来次
Yeah, again.

1097
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,890
停 滑 停
Pop. Slide. Pop.

1098
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:18,130
那天下课晚了半小时
Twirlers and Spinners let out half an hour late that day.

1099
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,260
刚太酷了 你自己琢磨出来的吗？
That's so rad. You figured that out by yourself?

1100
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,970
我就不断回放 反复看 最终学会的
Well, I just kept rewinding and rewinding 'til I figured it out.

1101
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,940
在舞会那天我们一起跳这个吧
We should do that at the Fling.

1102
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:35,230
呃 别误会 才不是要跟你谈恋爱
Uh, not as a date or anything.

1103
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,890
我跟道奇·温特沃斯在一起
I'm going out with Dougie Wentworth.

1104
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:39,480
你知道吧？
You know that, right?

1105
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:41,360
知道
Yeah.

1106
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:47,380
可这不妨碍我们露露绝活
But that doesn't mean we couldn't show them some cool moves.

1107
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,350
我超想跳 你呢？
I really want to. Do you?

1108
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,990
我 我不确定
I-I don't know.

1109
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,840
我太矮了
I'm a lot shorter.

1110
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:58,540
人们会笑话我的
I think people will laugh.

1111
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,600
-这管用 -确实管用
-That totally works. -It totally does.

1112
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,850
-确定吗？ -当然确定
-Are you sure? -Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

1113
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:19,890
感觉很好
Well, they feel great!

1114
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:22,810
就是码有点大
Uh, just a little big.

1115
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,240
差不多了
That should be enough.

1116
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,050
-再塞点 -再塞点
-Little more. -Maybe one more.

1117
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,790
怎么样？
How's that?

1118
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:34,430
就像溜冰一样
Floor feels like ice.

1119
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,840
要是把地板刮花 可要被揍
You put scratches on that floor, the janitor is gonna beat y...

1120
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:43,040
蒂米 不会刮花的 他很轻的
Timmy. There won't be no scratches. He's too light on his feet to leave any.

1121
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:46,920
几乎都对了
Almost perfect.

1122
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:53,510
这两题再算一遍
Take another run at these two.

1123
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,230
别叹气 你有这方面天赋 知道吗？
You don't need to sigh. You're good at this, you know?

1124
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,880
你真的很出色
You're really good at it.

1125
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,450
好吧 可这也太枯燥了
Yeah, but it's boring.

1126
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:04,230
枯燥？是说数学吗？
Boring? What, you mean math?

1127
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,410
嗯
Yeah.

1128
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:10,100
我觉得你下学期课后应该报个数学竞赛社
I wonder if maybe next semester you might want to try Math League after school.

1129
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:14,040
我整个高中都在参加 特有趣
I did it all high school, in fact, and it was so great.

1130
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:17,070
我现在报的是舞蹈社团
I'm doing Twirlers and Spinners.

1131
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,820
对
Yeah.

1132
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:23,630
嘿 先放下笔 先听我说说
Hey, hey, put that down for a second, will you?

1133
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,090
说点数学的事
Just a little about math.

1134
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,390
人们最初都以为它很枯燥
Because people start out thinking it might be boring,

1135
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:31,960
这就是错在起点
and that's their first mistake.

1136
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,410
无论干什么职业 做哪份工作
It's used in every career, in every job,

1137
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,480
地球上生活的方方面面都离不开它
in every facet of life on this planet.

1138
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,700
毋庸置疑 就连地球自己也离不开它
That's a fact. Hell, the planet.

1139
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,800
一天到底有多长？
How do you think we figure out how long a day is?

1140
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,340
谁都知道一天有多长
Everybody knows how long a day is.

1141
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,930
-多长？ -24小时
-How long? -Twenty-four hours.

1142
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:53,410
大家都说一天有24小时 但这是错的
People say it's 24 hours, but they're wrong.

1143
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:58,900
在恒星日中一天有23小时零56分钟
There are 23 hours and 56 minutes in a stellar day.

1144
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:02,510
还零几秒钟 数学可以证明
Plus a few odd seconds. Math proves it.

1145
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,950
怎么知道地球存在多久？
How do we know how old the Earth is?

1146
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:08,250
宇宙存在多久？人类又存在多久？
How old the universe is, how long people have been here?

1147
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:13,000
又怎么建桥 盖楼 测星距
Or how to build a bridge or a skyscraper or how far apart the stars are?

1148
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,830
怎么登月的？
How did we land on the moon?

1149
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:19,680
星星是怎么燃烧的？原子怎么聚变裂变的？
The stars themselves. Why they burn, why atoms split and fuse,

1150
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:22,840
这些都离不开数学
and all the rest is just math.

1151
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:25,580
星星本身就是数学产物
Hey, stars are just math.

1152
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,540
当你仰望夜空时
When you look at the night sky,

1153
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,630
看到的是宇宙最壮丽的方程式
you're seeing the greatest equation in the universe.

1154
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,460
更别说你的舞蹈 那也是数学
Heck, your dancing, that's math too.

1155
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,460
舞蹈的语言到底是什么？
I mean, what's the language of dance?

1156
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,450
你怎么学舞步的？
How do you learn your steps?

1157
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,040
名字就在那里 叫数拍
 It's even in the name. I mean, they call it "the count."

1158
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:44,680
一 二 三 四
One and two and three and four.

1159
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,510
华尔兹呢？一 二 三 一 二 三
What's a waltz? One, two, three, one, two, three.

1160
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,690
全是数字 都是数学
Just numbers, just math.

1161
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,800
不仅如此
And more than that,

1162
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:55,610
数学可以是门艺术
there's an art to it.

1163
01:24:55,630 --> 01:25:00,570
我干的活儿 你看这堆文件 这些档案
What I do, all these files here, all these folders,

1164
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:03,320
记录的都是人们的生活
these are all people's lives.

1165
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,970
他们每个选择
Every choice they made.

1166
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,390
去年 过去十年
Last year, last 10 years.

1167
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:10,540
他们在意的一切
Everything that's important to them.

1168
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,710
所有缺点 嗜好和梦想
Every weakness they have, every vice, every dream,

1169
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:17,670
全都体现在数字里
it's all here in numbers.

1170
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:20,150
要是哪个外行进来 生搬硬算
Some schmuck comes in, takes those numbers,

1171
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:24,160
缺了艺术感 就能害人丢了房子
does the math without artistry, someone loses their house.

1172
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:28,160
而我注入一丝艺术匠心
I take those numbers, do a little art,

1173
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,600
便能救人于难
I save someone's life.

1174
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,250
这就是会计的魅力
That's what I do.

1175
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:36,050
这就是会计的意义
That's what accounting is.

1176
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,110
也许他们该教这些有趣的
Well, maybe they should teach that, the cool stuff,

1177
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,300
别教枯燥的
and not just all the boring stuff.

1178
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,460
嗯
Hmm.

1179
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,710
数学可不止这些
Math is something else too.

1180
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:59,540
像统计学 概率学
Some math, math that's called statistics or probability,

1181
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,030
可以未卜先知
it can tell you stuff about your future.

1182
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:06,560
比方说
It could tell you, for example,

1183
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:10,630
你进职业球队的几率
you're more likely to be drafted by a major league sports team

1184
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:14,610
大过靠跳舞谋生
than to make a real living as a dancer.

1185
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,780
大家都爱看跳舞 没错
The world loves dancers, it truly does.

1186
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,700
可社会更需要会计师
But it needs accountants,

1187
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:28,840
需求大所以机会也多
so there's much more demand, so there's much more opportunity.

1188
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:33,050
我知道这话扎心 但这就是事实
I know that might hurt, but it's the truth.

1189
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:38,060
数学只讲事实 它不会撒谎
Math is truth. It won't lie to you.

1190
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:43,810
数学不掺感情 它就是这么纯粹
It doesn't factor in your preferences. It's pure that way.

1191
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,560
数学能做很多事
Math can do a lot of things.

1192
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,380
数学可以是门艺术
Math can be art.

1193
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,860
但数学可不会撒谎
But it can't lie.

1194
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,880
所以...
So...

1195
01:26:56,390 --> 01:27:00,560
再把那两题重算一遍吧
take another run at those two because, Chucko,

1196
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:03,520
小查 你很出色
you are good.

1197
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:07,990
你有 艺术细胞
You... have art in you.

1198
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,170
嘿！你今天超好看的！
Hey! You look great!

1199
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:54,260
谢谢 你也是
Thanks. Uh, you too.

1200
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:57,310
想不想给他们露两手？
Wanna show 'em how it's done?

1201
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:04,020
这个 我不 我 我可能扭到脚了
Uh, I don't know. I kinda, um...I kinda hurt my leg.

1202
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,090
真的假的？
You hurt your leg?

1203
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:09,660
要不 要不 等首更好的歌吧？
Maybe, maybe let's, let's wait for a better song.

1204
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,780
嘿 小子
Hey, kiddo.

1205
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:34,850
嘿
Hey.

1206
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,180
我以为你今晚要大放异彩呢
Thought you were gonna tear it up tonight.

1207
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:42,360
我 我也不知道
I don't, I don't know.

1208
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,520
鞋子怪怪的
My shoes feel all funny,

1209
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:48,470
我 我脚扭了
and... I hurt my leg.

1210
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:51,670
哦 你脚扭了？
Oh, you hurt your leg?

1211
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:53,020
嗯
Yeah.

1212
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:56,230
真替你可惜
I'm sorry to hear that.

1213
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,980
你一个人来的？
So, you came stag, huh?

1214
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,570
-啥？ -没有舞伴？
-Hmm? -No date.

1215
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,290
没 我
Nah, I...

1216
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:07,950
情况会变的 相信我 迟早会变 再等等
That'll change. Believe me, it'll change. Just give it some time.

1217
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,770
舞池里这些...
None of this, none of...

1218
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:12,650
舞池里这些都不重要
None of that out there really means anything.

1219
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:18,440
跳得怎样 都只是热身和演习 别把它当真
It's all just, just a scrimmage. Just a practice.

1220
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,830
嘿 这首正好 来跳吧
Hey, this is perfect. Come on.

1221
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:24,180
不行 我...
Nah, I'm still, uh...

1222
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,750
我脚还怪怪的
My leg's still wonky.

1223
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,660
查克 得了吧 让我们炸翻全场
Chuck, come on. We're gonna blow the roof off.

1224
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,370
对不起
I'm sorry.

1225
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,270
真的很痛
It really hurts.

1226
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:52,690
我从八岁就开始跳舞 又教体育
You know, I've been dancing since I was eight, and I teach PE,

1227
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,120
看过不少孩子受伤后的样子
and I've seen when my kids get hurt.

1228
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,630
他们走路都不一样了
I see how their walk changes.

1229
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,570
站姿也怪
I see how their posture changes.

1230
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,720
说句实话 在我看来
And don't mind me saying, but you look...

1231
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,400
查克 你看上去好好的
Well, you look fine to me, Chuck.

1232
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:11,060
我没逼你非得跟她跳 决定权在你
I'm not saying that you have to dance with the girl. It's up to you.

1233
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:16,200
我只想说 不管跳不跳 别说谎
 I'm just saying dance or no dance, you don't have to lie.

1234
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:19,650
跟她实话实说
Tell her the truth.

1235
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:23,700
她会理解的
She can take it.

1236
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,720
-准备好了吗？ -嗯 来跳吧
-You ready? -Yeah. Let's do it.

1237
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:05,520
再跳一遍！再跳一遍！
One more time! One more time!

1238
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:13,420
他们年纪虽小 却足够聪明知道何时收场
They may have been young, but they were smart enough to know when to quit.

1239
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:20,390
谢谢大家
Thank you, guys.

1240
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:25,700
在他39岁因脑瘤早逝前六个月
Six months before he died of a brain tumor at the unfair age of 39,

1241
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,440
趁头脑还算清楚
and while his mind was still working, mostly,

1242
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:35,750
他跟妻子珍妮坦白了手背上疤的来历
Chuck told his wife the truth about the scar on the back of his hand.

1243
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,620
最开始交往时
When they'd first started dating,

1244
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,250
他说这疤是那晚舞会后
he told her he'd gotten it from a boy named Doug Wentworth,

1245
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:46,150
舞伴凯特的男友温特沃斯因为吃醋
who was pissed about him dancing with his girlfriend at a middle school formal

1246
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:49,530
把他推到围栏上铁丝划的
and pushed him into a chain link fence outside the gym.

1247
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:52,710
这疤我没说真话
I lied about that, though.

1248
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:59,680
哇 你还是这么神秘
Oh, my. A man of secrets, even still.

1249
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,870
亲爱的 怎么弄的？
What happened, love?

1250
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:05,560
那晚舞跳完
When our fabulous dance was over, I...

1251
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:08,740
我全身又汗又热
I was sweaty and I was so hot.

1252
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,920
脸都热得通红
I-I felt like my cheeks were gonna catch fire.

1253
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:12,190
跳的太好了
You were great.

1254
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,870
-谢谢 -真是个大明星啊
-Thank you. -What a star.

1255
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:18,490
我那时只想逃离灯光
All I wanted in that moment was just darkness,

1256
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:24,950
吹吹凉风 一个人呆会儿
cool air, and to be by myself.

1257
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,720
那晚天空繁星闪烁
There were millions of stars that night.

1258
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,590
千万星辰
Millions of them.

1259
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,330
千层万叠
And millions more behind them.

1260
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:40,290
也许 嗯 它们只是天文数字
And sure, m-may... Yeah, maybe they were just math.

1261
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:42,920
却好像在翩翩起舞
But they also danced.

1262
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:47,380
我知道 因为那一瞬我看见了
I know 'cause I saw one of them.

1263
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,520
我那时想 宇宙边疆无限
And I remember thinking, the universe is large

1264
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,060
宇宙包罗万象
and, and it contains multitudes,

1265
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:58,460
也包含了我
but it-it also contains me.

1266
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:04,670
而在那一刻 我真觉得自己很精彩
And in this moment...I am wonderful.

1267
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:07,920
我理应拥有这份精彩
And I have a right to be wonderful.

1268
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,870
啊
Oh!

1269
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,160
干嘛为这事撒谎 小傻瓜
Why lie about that, silly?

1270
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:20,070
你真是个奇妙的存在 亲爱的
You're a strange wonder, my dear.

1271
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:26,990
他没再多说 因为那道疤另有深意
He doesn't offer more because the scar was important for another reason.

1272
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:30,170
是他讲不完的故事的一环
It was part of a story he couldn't tell,

1273
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:35,180
其中有他长大的那幢维多利亚老宅
even though there was now an apartment building on the site of the Victorian house

1274
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,740
尽管早拆了盖楼了
where he had done most of his growing up.

1275
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:42,960
那幢闹鬼的维多利亚老宅
The haunted Victorian house.

1276
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:44,860
不知道
No reason.

1277
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:48,100
就是心血来潮吧
Funny thinking, I guess.

1278
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:52,630
这疤意义非凡 他也尽力讲得加料
The scar meant more, so he had made it more.

1279
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:57,070
可讲得总没有它真正的意义深
He just couldn't make it as much more as it really was.

1280
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:59,290
讲得还有点糊涂
That made little sense.

1281
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:03,690
但随着脑癌细胞的疯狂进攻
But as the glioblastoma continued its blitzkrieg,

1282
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:09,910
他那快散架的大脑最多也只能讲到这样
it was the best his disintegrating mind could manage.

1283
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,640
查克的爷爷 他的阿爷
Chuck's grandpa, his Zaydee,

1284
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:49,470
在那场秋季舞会五年后 因心脏病发作去世
died of a heart attack five years after the Fall Fling dance.

1285
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:51,920
事发时查克读高二
Chuck was a junior in high school

1286
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,730
是乐队主唱
singing in a band and

1287
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,980
正在台上像摇滚巨星一样跳得带劲儿
dancing like Jagger during the instrumental breaks.

1288
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,220
他自己都安排妥当了
He made all the arrangements himself.

1289
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,120
几周前
Came in a few weeks ago

1290
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:05,730
还特地来馆里再确认一遍
just to make sure everything was to the letter,

1291
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:08,010
我还纳闷呢
which I thought was strange.

1292
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,390
很少有人这么上心
Not many people bother to do that.

1293
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:15,010
大多数人只来一趟定好流程
Most people, they come here once to set it all up.

1294
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:18,410
办好手续就不再来了
They aren't anxious to come back again.

1295
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:25,070
再见到那人 都是穿着体面衣服躺那儿 懂吧
Next time I see 'em, they're in their Sunday best, if you get me.

1296
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:29,180
他人特好 也是我多年的好友
He was a great man and a good friend.

1297
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,750
他为我们做账整整二十三年了
He's been doing our books for 23 years

1298
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:38,040
账做得稳 多次税务检查都帮我们顺利过关
and saved our skin more than once when the tax man was coming.

1299
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:41,340
要现在给你结账吗？
So, do I owe you any money?

1300
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,940
一分都不用
Not a penny.

1301
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,700
他那次来就把钱全给结清了
He took care of that too. Settled his tab that same visit.

1302
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,500
听我说
You know...

1303
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:53,050
最离奇的是
the strangest thing.

1304
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:56,400
这事儿很怪 可别觉得我扯
And this will sound strange, so bear with me.

1305
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:58,050
说来话长
See,

1306
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:03,110
年轻时我曾想当电视上天气预报员
I, uh, dreamed of being a television weatherman in my salad days

1307
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:05,850
也许能成全国台的
with maybe one of the networks.

1308
01:39:05,870 --> 01:39:07,980
最终没成
Wasn't in the cards for me.

1309
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:13,120
倒是去地方台待过一个夏天
But I did spend a summer at WKNB.

1310
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:17,950
在那儿 有个同事号称能
Well, there was a guy at KNB who they said

1311
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:23,930
不用雷达就能提前两周感知风暴
could feel a storm coming two solid weeks away without the radar.

1312
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,690
有第六感
Had a sixth sense.

1313
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,040
简直了
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

1314
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,350
他会露出一种神情
Uh, used to make this face,

1315
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:33,830
当别人说要出远门
this face when people talked about their travel plans,

1316
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,920
然后他洞察出什么后
if he knew something they didn't.

1317
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:40,930
那神情不笑不乐
Not... not a smile, per se. No joy in it.

1318
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:45,370
就一脸 我全知道的样子
Just a... knowing.

1319
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:48,310
我管那叫 预报员天眼
"Weatherman Stare," I called it.

1320
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,010
我可没那本事
And I didn't have it, not me.

1321
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:55,890
所以我在这行 而不是那行
So, I'm here, not there.

1322
01:39:56,130 --> 01:40:01,600
你爷爷来时也带着同样的神情
Your granddad had that same face when he was in here.

1323
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,730
像是 他早料到要下雨
Like... he knew it was gonna rain.

1324
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:10,480
而我只是个卖他伞的人
And I was just a guy selling him an umbrella.

1325
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,770
那就是预报员天眼
Weatherman Stare.

1326
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,370
我敢打包票
I'm sure of it.

1327
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:18,110
太离谱了
The strangest thing.

1328
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,450
爷爷阿尔比把一切家当都留给了他
Albie left him everything.

1329
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:25,090
这足够支付他的大学学费
More than enough to pay for his college education.

1330
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:28,450
再后来 他把那幢维多利亚老宅卖了
And later on, the sale of the Victorian

1331
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:30,430
用这笔钱买了
paid for the house he and Ginny moved into

1332
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:35,460
和他妻子珍妮度蜜月后住的新家
after their honeymoon in the Catskills.

1333
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:41,250
他铁了心不去奥马哈和外公外婆一起住
He flatly refused to move to Omaha to live with his mother's parents.

1334
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:43,160
-听着 我真的很爱你们... -他这样说
-Look, I love you guys... -He said.

1335
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:46,630
...但我在这里长大的 也想在这待到上大学
...but this is where I grew up and want to stay till college.

1336
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,690
我都17了 不是小孩子了
I'm 17. I'm not a baby.

1337
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:54,650
于是 早已退休的老两口 住进那幢维多利亚老宅
So, they, both long retired, came to him and stayed in the Victorian

1338
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:57,520
陪查克二十多个月
for the 20-odd months before Chuck went off

1339
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:01,840
直到他去伊利诺伊大学
to the University of Illinois.

1340
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,600
可他们没赶上参加葬礼
They weren't able to be there for the funeral, however.

1341
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:09,280
葬礼办得迅速利落 正如阿尔比所愿
It happened fast, as Albie had wanted,

1342
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:14,260
他外公外婆在奥马哈还有一些事要收尾
and his mom's folks had loose ends to tie up in Omaha.

1343
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:17,890
说实话 查克并不怎么想他们
Chuck didn't really miss them, if he was honest.

1344
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:25,750
他跟他阿爷一样 最讨厌瞎折腾 也受不了人多
His Zaydee hated a fuss almost as much as he hated a crowd.

1345
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,470
他们来的前一天
A day before they were scheduled to arrive,

1346
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:31,840
查克才拆开
Chuck finally opened the envelope

1347
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:36,120
放玄关桌上的那大信封
that had been sitting on the table in the front hall.

1348
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,870
信封是来自山姆·亚伯勒
It was from Sam Yarborough,

1349
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:42,960
亚伯勒殡仪馆的老板兼首席殡葬师
owner and chief undertaker at Yarborough Funeral Home,

1350
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:49,700
里面装着阿尔比·克兰兹的个人物品
and inside were Albie Krantz's personal effects.

1351
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:48,170
在这屋里 查克爷爷见过杰弗里家那男孩
In this room, Chuck's grandpa had seen the Jefferies boy,

1352
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:51,840
被车撞得血肉模糊
body broken by the car.

1353
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:56,230
他见过亨利·彼得森吊在天花板上
He'd seen Henry Peterson hanging from the ceiling.

1354
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:59,510
他还见过他妻子躺在地上断了气
He'd seen his own wife lying dead.

1355
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:01,930
查克想
And likely, Chuck supposed,

1356
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:05,970
也许就在那晚偷他钥匙的时候
perhaps the night Chuck had stolen his keys,

1357
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:10,330
阿尔比还看见自己摔倒在地
Albie had even seen himself crumpled to the floor,

1358
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:13,770
死死抓着胳膊
still clutching his upper arm.

1359
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:17,550
“这就是等待”他爷爷曾说
"It's the waiting," he'd said.

1360
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:20,640
“这是最难熬的”
"That's the hard part."

1361
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:24,950
现在轮到查克自己的煎熬了
Now Chuck's own waiting would begin.

1362
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:27,910
到底要等多久？
How long would that wait be?

1363
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:33,860
病床上那个人到底多少岁？
Exactly how old was the man in the hospital bed?

1364
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:42,180
看不见的监护仪发出最后一声“哔”
There was a final bip from the unseen monitor

1365
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,600
然后也随之消失
and then that was gone too.

1366
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:52,630
不像电影里那样慢慢淡去
The man did not fade, as ghostly apparitions did in the movies.

1367
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:55,280
就直接不见了
He was just gone.

1368
01:44:55,300 --> 01:45:00,080
仿佛从未出现过
Insisting he had never been there in the first place.

1369
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:02,930
-那不可能... -查克想
-He wasn't... -Chuck thinks.

1370
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:05,860
...我偏不信
...and I will insist he wasn't.

1371
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:11,520
我会痛痛快快地活 直到最后一刻
And I will live my life until my life runs out.

1372
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:14,280
我很精彩
I am wonderful.

1373
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:18,380
我配得上这份精彩
I deserve to be wonderful.

1374
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:22,620
我包罗万象
And I contain multitudes.
